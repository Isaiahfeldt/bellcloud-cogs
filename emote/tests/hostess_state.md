Expanded Recap - Day by Day:

**(Recap: Day 1 - Beginning - Expanded Detail)**\
Daylight was a fading memory, drowned beneath a relentless, chilling Orario downpour. Rain slicked the cobblestone
streets, turning them into dark mirrors that reflected the gloomy, overcast sky and the flickering gaslights already
being lit against the premature dusk. Each step Isaiah November (18, adventurer gear obscured partially by a practical
but travel-worn black cloak, its hem artfully tattered) took sent splashes of cold water upwards, the dampness seeping
persistently into the lower edges of his trousers despite his sturdy boots. He was weary down to his bones, the final
leg of his long journey on foot after the carriage dropped him off having drained his reserves. Beneath the cloak, his
lean, muscular frame ached, and the meager weight of his coin pouch felt insultingly light against the backdrop of this
legendary, overwhelming city. Ambition burned fiercely within him – the desire to conquer the Dungeon, join the mighty
Freya Familia, become the best – but immediate, grinding needs clawed at him: warmth, food, shelter from the oppressive
rain.

It was then that the Hostess of Fertility appeared like a beacon through the grey sheets of rain. Warm, golden light
spilled from its leaded glass windows, outlining cheerful silhouettes within. The distant sounds of laughter, clinking
mugs, and lively conversation carried faintly, promising refuge. Compared to the cold, indifferent stone facades
surrounding it, the tavern radiated life. Drawn by an almost primal need for respite, Isaiah pushed open the heavy, dark
wooden door, the small bell above announcing his arrival with a muffled jingle almost lost in the tavern's cheerful din.
The transition was immediate and overwhelming. Warmth enveloped him, thick with the scents of woodsmoke from a large,
roaring hearth dominating one wall, roasting meat, baking bread, spilled ale, and damp wool drying near the fire. The
air buzzed with conversation, a comforting wall of sound after the lonely drumming of the rain. The interior was all
dark, polished wood – heavy ceiling beams, sturdy tables and chairs, booth partitions offering pockets of privacy.
Lanterns hung strategically, casting inviting pools of light, glinting off polished mugs behind a long, busy bar
overseen by a large, imposing woman Isaiah would later learn was Mama Mia. The place was comfortably crowded, a haven
for rain-soaked travelers and adventurers taking a rest day.

His eyes, adjusting from the gloom outside, swept the room, and immediately snagged on her. An elf waitress moving
between tables with a grace that seemed almost out of place. She carried a heavy tray laden with food, yet her posture
remained perfectly upright, her movements fluid and economical, utterly composed amidst the surrounding bustle. Her
long, pale green hair was neatly kept, framing delicate elven ears, and her expression was one of serene neutrality.
This was Ryu Lion, working under her alias. Isaiah, requesting a booth when she approached him near the entrance, found
himself instantly intrigued. It wasn't just her beauty, common enough among elves, but her stillness, her almost
unnerving calm. It felt like a placid lake surface hinting at unfathomable depths, a stark contrast to the noisy,
rough-and-tumble world of adventurers she served. A spark of fascination ignited within him, an unexpected pull towards
this enigmatic waitress.

Ryu acknowledged his request with a slight, polite nod. "This way, Sir." Her voice was soft, yet clear and precise.
Isaiah followed her deeper into the tavern, watching the quiet efficiency of her movements as she led him towards a
relatively secluded booth against the far wall, away from the main traffic near the bar. Taking his seat on the wooden
bench, the dampness of his cloak clinging slightly, Isaiah acted on habit, unclipping his two daggers from their
concealed sheathes beneath his cloak and placing them beside him on the dark wood table – tools kept close, ready, a
reflex born of solitary survival. Ryu's eyes flickered towards the blades for just an instant, acknowledging their
presence without comment, her professional mask undisturbed.

"Might I offer you a menu?" she inquired politely, standing attentatively near the booth. "Or perhaps something warm to
drink while you peruse it? We have a fine stew today, excellent for warding off the chill of the rain." Her words
blurred slightly as Isaiah found himself once again studying her face, trying to decipher the source of that compelling
composure. Was it practiced? Natural? What lay behind those calm, pale green eyes? Damn it, he thought, realizing
belatedly he'd missed her question entirely, caught staring like a green boy. He mentally shook himself. "Ah, forgive
me," he managed, hoping his lapse wasn't too obvious, meeting her gaze properly. "My mind was elsewhere for a moment.
What was it you were offering?"

Ryu showed no outward reaction to his brief lapse in attention, no judgment in her steady gaze. "It is quite alright,
Sir," she replied, her voice maintaining its calm rhythm. "Weariness can easily distract." She repeated her offer with
practiced ease – menu, warm drink, today's stew. Isaiah, deciding quickly, ordered ale, wanting it immediately, and the
stew. "Any ale will do," he specified, feeling the need for something strong and grounding. He politely declined her
offer to take his still-damp cloak, the instinct to keep his few possessions close, especially in an unfamiliar place,
overriding the desire for dry fabric.

Just as Ryu gave a small nod and turned silently towards the bar to fetch his drink, a sudden impulse struck Isaiah. "
What is your name?" he called out, his voice perhaps a touch louder than intended, cutting through the tavern noise. She
paused mid-stride, the movement completely silent, and turned her head slightly, looking back at him over her shoulder.
Her serene expression held perhaps the faintest flicker of surprise at the direct, personal question from a new patron,
but it settled back instantly into polite neutrality. "You may call me Ryu, Sir," she replied, her voice soft yet
carrying clearly.

She held his gaze for a charged moment before turning fully back towards the bar, resuming her path
without further comment. As she walked away, Isaiah felt an unexpected warmth bloom in his chest, a strange positive
feeling sparked by the simple exchange of her name, the brief connection in her gaze. It lingered, a small point of
light against the damp chill clinging to his cloak and the weariness in his bones, leaving him thoughtful as he awaited
his ale.\
(End of Recap: Day 1 - Beginning - Expanded Detail)

**(Recap: Day 1 - Middle - Expanded Detail)**\
Ryu returned promptly from the bar, moving with that same quiet grace that Isaiah found so captivating. She placed a
sturdy mug filled with dark, foaming ale on the table before him, ensuring it was within easy reach but clear of the
daggers he'd left there. "Your ale, Sir," she stated calmly, adding, "The stew is being ladled now; it will only be
another moment." Her gaze rested neutrally on him for a second before she moved away again with silent efficiency.

Isaiah took a sip of the ale; it was strong, robust, with a slightly bitter bite followed by a malty warmth – grounding,
uncomplicated, and welcome against the persistent chill of the rain drumming against the tavern windows.
While Ryu was away fetching the stew, Isaiah took the opportunity for a quick, discreet assessment of his finances.
Reaching under his damp cloak, he pulled out his worn leather coin pouch, keeping it low. Loosening the drawstring, the
muted clink of Valis confirmed his precarious situation – enough for this meal, perhaps, but reserves were critically
thin after the journey. He quickly secured the pouch just as he heard Ryu's soft footsteps approaching again.

She arrived bearing a steaming bowl of savory-smelling stew – rich with meat, vegetables, and herbs. Placing it
carefully opposite his ale, she inquired neutrally, "Is there anything else I might bring you for the moment? Bread,
perhaps?" Isaiah, his attention momentarily drifting back to the intriguing depth in her pale green eyes, shook off the
distraction. "No bread, thank you," he replied. "The stew and ale are sufficient." Then, focusing on practicalities, he
asked, "Does this establishment offer lodging as well?"

Ryu politely explained that the Hostess primarily served food and drink and didn't offer public lodging directly, but
mentioned there were several reputable inns nearby on the same street, offering to provide directions once he finished
his meal. Isaiah looked down at the table, considering. Asking for simple directions felt impersonal, less interesting
than potentially interacting with her more. He felt a pull, a curiosity about the person behind the composed waitress
facade. Making a decision that felt like a gamble, he looked back up at her. "As it happens, I am quite new to Orario,"
he stated, choosing his words carefully. "Perhaps... when your duties here are concluded for the day... would you be
amenable to showing me the way to one of those inns? I confess, I would be grateful for the guidance." He watched her
closely, knowing it was a bold, possibly improper request, wondering how she would react.

Ryu's calm expression remained largely unchanged, but there was a fractional pause, a momentary assessment in her eyes.
She then delivered a polite but firm refusal, establishing a clear professional boundary without overt coldness. "Sir,"
she began, her voice maintaining its steady cadence, "while I appreciate the sentiment... my responsibilities extend
only to my service here... It would be improper for me to accompany a patron after my shift concludes. However, I assure
you, the directions are quite straightforward. Once you are ready to leave, I can describe the route very clearly." With
a small, formal nod, she turned to attend another table, leaving Isaiah feeling subtly but definitively rebuffed.

Examining her demeanor as she walked away, Isaiah noted her unwavering composure – straight back, fluid, silent steps,
no hesitation or backward glance. It conveyed pure professionalism and a gentle reinforcement of the boundary she'd set.
Internally, Isaiah felt the sting of the polite rejection more than expected (Damn... shot down.). It felt like a loss,
a missed opportunity to learn more about her. He briefly resolved to find another way to gain her interest later (Okay,
plan B. Time to observe and rethink.) but decided pushing further now was foolish.

He ate a few more spoonfuls of the hearty stew, his mind preoccupied. Deciding that some objectives couldn't be rushed,
he reached for his coin pouch again. He carefully counted out Valis to cover the stew and ale (estimated cost around
120-140 Valis), adding a reasonable amount extra as a tip or perhaps just to avoid needing exact change handled by Ryu,
leaving maybe 150-170 Valis total on the table. He stood up quietly, adjusting his damp cloak, and headed directly for
the door, initially intending to forgo the offered directions out of pride or reluctance after being turned down on the
personal request.\
(End of Recap: Day 1 - Middle - Expanded Detail)

**(Recap: Day 1 - Ending - Expanded Detail)**\\
Isaiah stood at the heavy wooden door of the Hostess of Fertility, one foot halfway out into the driving rain, ready to
leave his awkward interactions with Ryu behind and find lodging on his own. Pride, perhaps, or the sting of her earlier
refusal to guide him personally, made him reluctant to ask again for the directions she'd offered. Just as he was about
to pull the door fully open, Ryu's calm, clear voice cut through the tavern's hubbub: "Sir." He froze, turning to see
her standing composedly across the room. "Thank you for your patronage," she said with a polite nod. "You are departing
without the directions I offered. Have you perhaps recalled the way, or made other arrangements?"

Caught, and realizing the foolishness of wandering lost in the rain, Isaiah pulled his foot back inside. "Ah..." he
stammered slightly, feeling awkward. "You are right. Forgive me... Yes, those directions would still be most helpful,
Miss Ryu. Thank you." Ryu, maintaining her professional neutrality, gave a slight nod and proceeded to give him clear,
concise directions. "The most straightforward option... is 'The Weary Traveler'. Exit... turn right... continue two
blocks – you will pass a shop with a large anvil sign, belonging to the Hephaistus Familia. Immediately after... take
the next left onto a smaller side street. Third building on your right..." She also offered 'The Gilded Flagon' as a
slightly larger alternative further down the main street.

Checking the grey, rain-streaked view through the window, Isaiah estimated it was late afternoon, perhaps between 4 and
6 PM, the storm making it feel closer to dusk. Satisfied with the directions, he offered Ryu a sincere thank you and a
respectful bow from the shoulders. "May your evening be peaceful." With that, he decisively pushed the door open and
stepped out into the relentless downpour, turning right as instructed.

As he walked, head bowed against the rain, a sudden, sickening realization hit him. Shit. My daggers. His hand
instinctively went to his side beneath his cloak, finding only empty space. He'd left them sitting on the table back at
the Hostess, distracted by Ryu. Idiot. Annoyed at his carelessness, but deciding turning back immediately was
counterproductive, he made a firm mental note: return first thing tomorrow to retrieve them, hoping Ryu or someone else
had secured them.

Putting the mistake aside, he continued through the rain. Just as Ryu described, he soon spotted the large anvil sign
marking the Hephaistus Familia workshop. He paused briefly under the overhang, peering through the rain-streaked window
at the impressive display of swords, axes, and armor within, admiring the solid craftsmanship – a stark contrast, he
thought, to Ryu's ethereal mystery. Lost in thought – about the daggers, Ryu, his general weariness – he lingered
perhaps a moment too long.

The sound of a heavy door latch clicking snapped him back. The workshop door opened slightly, revealing a stoutly built
woman in her late twenties/early thirties, wearing a heavy leather apron dusted with soot, dark hair tied back severely.
Her sharp, assessing eyes landed on him. "Oi," she called out gruffly, her voice rough but clear over the rain. "You
planning on buyin' somethin', or just gonna drip all over the pavement blockin' the view? If you're comin' in, come in.
If not, move along." Isaiah, caught off guard, quickly apologized. "My apologies. Just... admiring the craftsmanship.
Didn't mean to block the way. Lost in thought." With a quick, apologetic nod, he turned and hurried away, refocusing on
finding the inn.

Following Ryu's directions – past the anvil sign, left onto the next side street – he soon spotted the simple wooden
sign depicting a backpack: 'The Weary Traveler'. The modest, two-story building glowed with warm light, promising
refuge. Relief washed over him. Pushing open the heavy door, he was met with the welcome warmth, the smell of woodsmoke
and drying wool, and the low noise of a simple common room. He stopped on the entryway mat to shake and stomp the worst
of the rain off his cloak and boots.

He approached the counter, where the portly, bald innkeeper with shrewd eyes looked up from wiping the surface. The
innkeeper grunted a greeting ("Evenin'. Lookin' for a drink, or somethin' more?"). Isaiah requested a room for the
evening. The innkeeper confirmed availability ("Got a couple rooms left... simple, mind you... bed, wash basin, chamber
pot") and stated the price: 150 Valis, payable upfront. Isaiah confirmed for one night only, acutely aware this was a
significant portion of his remaining funds after paying for his meal at the Hostess earlier. Beneath his cloak, he
retrieved the coins and slid the 150 Valis across the counter.

The innkeeper collected the payment, grunted, and handed over a simple iron key on a wooden tag marked '4'. "Up the
stairs," he instructed, nodding towards a narrow staircase, "second door on yer left. Keep the noise down after midnight
bell." He mentioned the fire for drying off and offered ale, but Isaiah, focused only on rest, simply thanked him, took
the key, and headed upstairs.

Finding the faded number '4' on a simple plank door, he unlocked it and stepped inside, immediately locking it behind
him for privacy. The room was sparse, as promised: the narrow bed with a thin mattress and rough blanket, a small wooden
chair, a rickety wash basin stand with a pitcher. But it was dry and quiet. With a sigh of profound relief, Isaiah shed
his heavy, sodden black cloak, draping it over the chair. He followed with his damp mustard-yellow jacket and dark
undershirt, laying them out to dry as well. Standing in just trousers and boots, he felt lighter, less cold. He then sat
on the creaking bed to pull off his heavy, mud-caked boots and gloves.

Looking at the basin, he decided a wash was needed. The thought of potentially seeing Ryu tomorrow briefly made him
consider wanting to look presentable, a thought he immediately dismissed internally as childish foolishness (Look nice
for a girl? Get a grip.). Still, washing was practical. Finding the pitcher filled with clean, cold water, he used it
and a rough towel to wash away the worst of the travel grime. Listening intently, he noted the inn was quiet, perhaps
hearing only faint, indistinct sounds from adjacent rooms or the hallway.

Before sleep, driven by habit, he took inventory of his meager belongings from his slender brown backpack laid out on
the bed: two carefully saved health potions from home, a depleted supply of hardtack and jerky, a waterskin (nearly
empty), rope, flint and steel, a whetstone (useless without his daggers), and a few sundries like spare socks and cord.
Not much between him and starvation if things went poorly.

Finally, utterly exhausted from the travel, the rain, the encounters, and the constant low-level stress of his
situation, Isaiah collapsed onto the thin mattress. He pulled the rough blanket up, stared at the shadowed ceiling for
only a moment, listening to the rain finally beginning to soften outside, and succumbed quickly to the overwhelming need
for sleep, falling into a deep, dreamless darkness.\
*(End of Recap: Day 1 - Ending - Expanded Detail)*

**(Recap: Day 2 - Beginning - Expanded Detail)**\
Isaiah awoke slowly in the small, sparse room of 'The Weary Traveler'. The relentless drumming of rain from the previous
day had ceased. Weak sunlight filtered through the single window, indicating morning had arrived, though the sky outside
was likely still overcast or cloudy based on the quality of the light. His body felt stiff and sore from the previous
day's long journey and the less-than-comfortable mattress, but the deep exhaustion had thankfully receded after a night
of solid sleep. The air in the room was cool. His clothes, draped over the chair, were significantly drier but likely
still held a hint of dampness.

The first pressing thoughts were practical. Money. He had spent nearly all his Valis on the room (150) and the meal at
the Hostess (~160) yesterday, leaving him critically low – perhaps less than 100 Valis remaining, maybe significantly
less. This meant breakfast was a luxury he couldn't afford. His stomach rumbled, reminding him of his hunger. Then, the
memory of the forgotten daggers resurfaced – retrieving those from the Hostess was an immediate priority. And
overarching everything was the fundamental need to find a Familia and gain Falna, the prerequisite for becoming a real
adventurer and earning income, as learned from the Guild advisor yesterday.

Sounds and smells drifted up from the common room downstairs – clattering mugs, muffled voices, the unmistakable,
tempting aroma of frying bacon. This sparked a risky idea born of desperation and hunger. Knowing he couldn't afford
breakfast, and possessing notable dexterity (DEX +3, Sleight of Hand +5 proficiency established later), Isaiah
considered attempting to steal some food.

Getting dressed quickly in his mostly dry gear (undershirt, mustard jacket, chest plate, trousers, boots, gloves –
leaving the cloak for now), he headed downstairs. The common room was moderately active with patrons eating breakfast.
The same portly innkeeper was behind the counter. Isaiah, needing to leave but drawn by the bacon smell, lingered near
the tables. He spotted a burly traveler momentarily distracted from his plate. Seeing an opportunity, Isaiah decided to
act.

As he walked casually past the traveler's table, seemingly heading for the door, Isaiah used his practiced Sleight of
Hand. His hand darted out subtly, snatching several strips of bacon from the plate without the owner noticing. The
action was described as requiring a skill check: `/Roll Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)`. The Difficulty Class (DC) was set
by the AI Narrator at 14 (moderate difficulty due to the public setting but aided by the target's distraction). The AI
executed the roll: d20 + 5 (Dex modifier + Proficiency). The result was **14**, a **Success!**

Isaiah successfully pilfered the bacon without being detected and quickly exited the inn, eating the stolen breakfast as
he walked, feeling a small thrill of victory mixed with the satisfaction of easing his hunger, though knowing it was
only a temporary fix. His immediate destination: The Hostess of Fertility, to retrieve his forgotten daggers and perhaps
catch another glimpse of Ryu.\
*(End of Recap: Day 2 - Beginning - Expanded Detail)*

**(Recap: Day 2 - Middle - Expanded Detail)**\
Walking through the brighter, post-rain morning streets of Orario, Isaiah finished the last of the stolen bacon. His
thoughts turned back to the Hostess of Fertility and the task at hand: retrieving his daggers. He arrived at the
familiar tavern, finding it open and moderately busy with the late morning crowd.

Upon entering, his eyes scanned for Ryu. Instead, he was greeted first by **Anya Fromel**, the cheerful, energetic
cat-girl waitress. Recognizing him vaguely from the day before, she bounced over, asking if he needed a table or was
lost. Isaiah politely declined, explaining he was there to retrieve something he'd left behind. Internally, he noted her
bubbly demeanor and feline features as 'cute' but found she didn't hold the same captivating mystery as Ryu.
Taking a chance, Isaiah decided to probe Anya for information, perhaps hoping to gain insight into Ryu. Stepping
slightly closer, he asked Anya about her colleague, "Miss Ryu," commenting on her composure and professionalism, using
the flimsy excuse of being curious about people in the city. Anya, delighted by the apparent interest and perhaps prone
to gossip, leaned in conspiratorially. She described Ryu ("Ryu-senpai") with a mix of awe and slight fear – calling her
elegant, amazing at her job, quiet, mysterious, doesn't talk about herself, but sometimes gets a scary look in her eye
like she could "kick butt." Just as Anya playfully asked Isaiah if he had a crush on Ryu, **Ryu herself appeared**,
having seemingly overheard or simply finished a task nearby.

Isaiah, caught slightly off guard, opened his mouth to reply to Anya but was cut off by Ryu's arrival. He instinctively
stepped back from Anya, feeling slightly awkward. Ryu, perfectly composed as always, addressed him formally ("Sir") and
inquired if he'd found lodging, referencing their conversation from the previous day. Isaiah, flustered but recovering,
confirmed the lodging was adequate and thanked her for the directions, then stated the real reason for his return: he'd
foolishly left his daggers on the table yesterday and hoped they'd been found.

Ryu, without judgment, confirmed she had noticed the daggers after his departure and secured them behind the counter for
safekeeping. Excusing herself briefly, she went to retrieve them. While she was gone, Isaiah examined her demeanor,
noting again her unwavering calm and professionalism. Ryu returned shortly, presenting the daggers hilt-first. Isaiah
observed *how* she held them – not awkwardly, but with a firm, balanced, almost natural familiarity that seemed unusual
for a waitress, subtly hinting at her hidden capabilities. He thanked her sincerely, apologizing again for his
oversight.

Wanting to see *some* crack in her perfect facade, Isaiah decided to push slightly. He commented directly on her
composure, calling it "remarkable," "unusual," and "almost practiced," especially working in a place surrounded by rough
adventurers. He watched closely for any reaction. Ryu paused fractionally, something unreadable flickering deep in her
eyes for an instant (*Practiced... yes*), before offering the faintest polite smile that didn't reach her eyes. She
calmly deflected, attributing her demeanor purely to professional necessity ("Maintaining a professional atmosphere is
simply part of providing good service.

One learns to focus on one's duties.") and asked if he required anything further.
Feeling thoroughly defeated by her impenetrable composure, Isaiah quietly replied, "No, that will be all. Thank you." He
gave her a final respectful bow, nodded briefly to Anya, and left the Hostess, his daggers retrieved but his fascination
with Ryu deepening, now mixed with frustration. He realized with some annoyance that Ryu still didn't know his name.
Now properly armed but still needing a Familia, Isaiah headed towards the **Adventurer's Guild Headquarters** near Babel
Tower. The vast hall was bustling with adventurers.

He scanned the impressive interior, noting the emblems of major
Familias, which sparked a jarring realization: he'd been so focused on immediate needs he'd barely thought about *how*
to actually join a Familia. He decided to focus on the Guild first and figure out the Familia situation later. Unsure
who to approach, he looked for Guild employees, spotting several behind long counters processing requests. Driven by his
stated preference ("having a thing for elves"), he located a female elf advisor (**Eina Tulle**) and joined her queue.\
*(End of Recap: Day 2 - Middle - Expanded Detail)*

**(Recap: Day 2 - Ending - Expanded Detail)**\
Waiting in line for the Guild Advisor **Eina Tulle**, Isaiah observed her brisk, efficient, professional demeanor as she
dealt with other adventurers. When it was his turn, he introduced himself ("Isaiah November") and stated his desire to
register as an adventurer, admitting his unfamiliarity with the Orario process. Eina, professional but perhaps slightly
impatient (later revised to be slightly warmer/more concerned after meta-discussion/retcon), explained that official
registration required **Familia affiliation and Falna** first, as the Guild primarily managed blessed adventurers. This
confirmed Isaiah's earlier oversight and presented a major hurdle.

Isaiah, deciding honesty was the best policy, admitted he'd only just arrived and hadn't yet joined a Familia, asking
for advice on how to proceed. Eina, possibly softened slightly by his earnestness (and the subtle 'protagonist aura'),
confirmed the requirement was absolute but offered guidance: check public notice boards (including a smaller one within
the Guild) for recruitment flyers, or approach Familia Homsteads directly, cautioning him about less reputable Familias.
She reiterated he couldn't register *today* and needed to secure Familia membership first. Isaiah, surprisingly
energized by having a clear (if difficult) path forward, thanked Eina enthusiastically. As he started to leave, he
realized he hadn't gotten her name, quickly returned to her counter (politely this time, not shouting from the door
after meta-correction), and asked who he should thank upon his return. Eina, surprised by his earnest return, offered a
rare, small smile, introduced herself as **Eina Tulle**, and gave brief encouragement ("Be persistent, present yourself
honestly... Do not be discouraged").

Leaving the Guild, Isaiah felt the pressure: low on funds, needing Falna *now*. He checked the smaller **Familia
recruitment board** Eina mentioned. He noted flyers for Ganesha (laborers), Takemikazuchi (diligent souls/combat), Dian
Cecht (alchemists), Miach (open/support/poor), Soma (dedicated/abstinence), Hephaistus (forge assistants/Tsubaki - this
notice later vanished), a sketchy 'Swiftfoot Brigade' (also vanished later), and a very unprofessional, handwritten note
for **Hestia Familia** ("Recruiting!?... Strong people preferred? Ask the Goddess Hestia!")
His initial goal was the **Freya Familia**, wanting to join the strongest to become the best. Disappointed they weren't
listed (as expected for an elite Familia), he considered his options. He recalled seeing the Hephaistus workshop
yesterday, making that name stand out. He pondered Miach (easy entry? slow growth?) and Takemikazuchi (better for
combat? stricter entry?). Despite logic pointing elsewhere, a strong **gut feeling** pulled him towards the messy,
obscure Hestia Familia notice. He rationalized that maybe a blank slate Familia offered more freedom, or perhaps it was
just intuition, similar to the feeling that got him a second chance with Hedin (though the narrative later settled on
the Hedin event being a potential latent skill). He took the Hestia flyer.

Now needing to act decisively before funds ran out completely (his Valis likely extremely low, maybe under 50 after
paying 150 for the first night's inn), Isaiah made a bold, reckless decision fueled by frustration and ambition. He
decided *not* to pursue the flyers immediately but to return to **Folkvangr**, the Freya Familia Homestead on Daedalus
Street. His new plan: force an audience by **challenging a gate guard** to a fight, hoping to impress through sheer
audacity and combat potential, even without Falna.

Recognizing the immense risk, he consumed his remaining emergency rations (hardtack/jerky) and his *second-to-last*
health potion for a slight edge. Fueled by determination (and thoughts of impressing **Ryu** by joining the best), he
marched back to Daedalus Street as late afternoon/early evening approached. He found Folkvangr again, approached the
imposing gates guarded by elite adventurers (**Sergeant Valen** being one), and directly issued a challenge: "I
challenge you. Right here. Right now. Draw your weapon."

The guard (Valen) reacted with cold disdain, calling Isaiah pathetic and refusing to engage seriously. Isaiah, needing
to force the confrontation, continued with pointed taunts about the guard's pride and the Familia's reputation,
questioning if they were afraid to fight a "street rat." He adopted a ready stance, relying on his speed and reflexes (
Dexterity +3).

His taunts finally angered Valen, who drew his longsword with lethal intent, stating, "You have my attention. Now you'll
learn the cost..." Valen advanced slowly, deliberately, aiming to control the fight. Isaiah, realizing a direct clash
was suicide, used his agility. He exploded *sideways* to disrupt Valen's advance. As he moved, he launched an
opportunistic dagger strike (`/Roll Attack` vs AC 17, Modifier +5) which **missed**, glancing off the guard's superior
armor.

Undeterred, Isaiah continued maneuvering, feinting and darting, launching another probing attack (`/Roll Attack` vs AC
17, Modifier +5). This time, miraculously, he **hit!** The dagger found a small gap, drawing a superficial wound and a
grunt of surprised anger from Valen. Wounded in pride and body, Valen lunged furiously with a powerful downward strike
meant to end the fight. Relying on pure reflex, Isaiah executed a high-risk **parry** with both daggers (`/Roll Parry` -
success granted by user meta-request to progress story). Sparks flew as he barely deflected the Falna-enhanced blow,
leaving Valen momentarily stunned and off-balance.

Just as Isaiah lunged forward instinctively to press the counter-attack, a commanding voice cut through the air: **"
Enough."** A side door in the main gate opened, revealing a powerful, silver-haired elf radiating immense authority – *
*Hedin Selland**. Both guards snapped to attention; Valen paled, lowering his sword.
Isaiah immediately sheathed his daggers, bowed deeply, apologized for the disturbance, and explained his actions stemmed
from desperation for a chance to join, not malice. Hedin observed him coolly, acknowledging the landed blow and
successful parry without Falna as anomalies. He questioned Isaiah's motives: "Why Freya Familia? What makes you believe
you are worthy...?"

At this point, the **time loop event** occurred (initially a meta-request, later framed as a potential latent skill).
Isaiah experienced a ~2-minute rewind to the moment Hedin asked the question. Aware of the previous outcome (where his
speech about ambition led to dismissal), Isaiah capitalized on this second chance.
Instead of focusing solely on abstract willpower, Isaiah gave a **revised plea**. He pointed to the *evidence* of the
fight – landing a blow, parrying a Falna-enhanced strike, all without Falna – as proof of existing raw potential (
reflexes, spirit). He appealed to the Freya Familia's reputation for *forging* greatness, asking if they recognized raw
material, not just finished products. He presented himself as that raw material, needing their blessing and guidance to
reach his peak.

Hedin listened intently, perhaps intrigued or surprised by the more sophisticated argument and the concrete evidence
cited. While still dismissing entry based on potential alone, he didn't reject Isaiah outright this time. Instead, he
issued an **impossible challenge**: 1. Gain Falna (find *any* Familia). 2. Enter the Dungeon. 3. Reach **Level 2 faster
than any adventurer in Guild history** (Ais Wallenstein's ~1 year record cited later as the benchmark). 4. Return to
Folkvangr *only* when this record is broken, with Guild proof. If successful, Hedin promised to personally grant an
audience. Failure, or returning early, was implicitly disastrous. With that, Hedin shut the door, leaving Isaiah with
the daunting condition.

Isaiah, strangely, didn't feel crushed. The impossible challenge, combined with the bizarre time loop, felt like *fate*,
like a validation of his ambition. He felt it was achievable ("I can do this"). His immediate goal shifted: find *any*
Familia, get Falna, start the clock.

Realizing he was now incredibly broke and still needed lodging for the night, he decided to return to **'The Weary
Traveler'**. He arrived late in the evening. Knowing he couldn't afford the 150 Valis rate, he approached the gruff
innkeeper. Laying his situation bare (failed Familia search, low funds), he offered his remaining Valis (estimated ~70)
plus his **last remaining health potion** as collateral for the room for *this* night (Day 2), promising to pay the 80
Valis balance by sundown the *next* day (Day 3). The innkeeper, after examining the valuable potion, grudgingly accepted
the deal due to the collateral covering his risk, emphasizing the strict sundown deadline for repayment. Isaiah,
relieved to have shelter, took the key to Room 4 and finally went to sleep, exhausted but with a clear, albeit
near-impossible, goal set before him.\
*(End of Recap: Day 2 - Ending - Expanded Detail)*

**(Recap: Day 3 - Beginning - Expanded Detail)**\
Isaiah awoke on Day 3 in the familiar, sparse room (#4) at 'The Weary Traveler', having secured the night's lodging
through the desperate bargain involving his last health potion as collateral. He felt the pressure immediately: he had
until sundown *today* to earn 80 Valis to pay the innkeeper and reclaim his vital potion. More importantly, he needed to
begin tackling Hedin Selland's monumental challenge, which required finding a Familia and gaining Falna as the absolute
first step.His mind immediately went to the **Guild Hall**.

He needed information, specifically the actual record for
reaching Level 2 that Hedin had challenged him to break. He also needed to revisit the Familia recruitment board or find
leads, now that joining *any* Familia had become the immediate priority.He got dressed in his usual gear (mustard
jacket, chest plate, etc. – *excluding* the cloak which remained in the room for now, as established later before the
first Dungeon delve), ensuring his daggers were secure. Leaving the inn early, he headed back towards the Guild
Headquarters.Arriving at the Guild Hall relatively early in the morning, he found it already beginning to fill with
adventurers starting their day. His first stop was the service counters, specifically seeking out **Advisor Eina Tulle
**, who had been helpful (in her professional way) yesterday.

He queued again, observing the organized chaos of the
Guild.When he reached Eina, she recognized him ("Mr. November. Back already?"). Isaiah, trying to sound less desperate
than he felt, explained he wasn't there for registration yet, but needed specific information related to the "
conditional encouragement" he'd received (vaguely referencing Hedin's challenge without naming names or Familias).
Acknowledging her likely surprise at the unusual nature of his query, he asked directly: "What is the fastest time
officially recorded by the Guild for an adventurer to reach Level 2 after first receiving their Falna at Level 1?"Eina
reacted with clear incredulity, questioning why an unblessed newcomer would ask about record-breaking speed. However,
perhaps influenced by Isaiah's earnestness from the previous day and the subtle 'protagonist aura', she provided the
information professionally, albeit with significant concern.

She revealed the commonly cited benchmark belonged to **Ais
Wallenstein** of the Loki Familia, who achieved Level 2 in approximately **one year**. Eina stressed the immense
difficulty, danger, and requirements (talent, luck, effort, Familia support) involved in such a feat, strongly
cautioning Isaiah against recklessly trying to emulate it, especially without Falna or experience.When Eina asked *why*
he needed this information, Isaiah deflected. Knowing the truth about Hedin's challenge would sound insane, he instead
framed it as needing to understand the absolute highest benchmarks to fuel his own intense ambition and set aspirational
goals, however distant. Eina, while likely skeptical, accepted the deflection but reiterated her concern, advising him
to focus on finding a *supportive* Familia, learning fundamentals, and prioritizing survival through steady, pragmatic
growth. Her tone shifted from purely professional to genuinely worried, urging him to be careful. Isaiah, while
appreciating her concern, internally felt his conviction reinforced; proving her wrong became another motivator.

He left
the counter feeling a slightly stronger connection to the concerned advisor.His next step was to re-examine the *
*Familia Recruitment Board** with a new perspective. He mentally discarded the non-adventuring options (Ganesha, Dian
Cecht) and noted the Hephaistus flyer for forge work was now gone, as was the sketchy 'Swiftfoot Brigade' notice. This
left Takemikazuchi (discipline/combat), Miach (open/support/poor), potentially Soma (dedicated/weird rules), and the
messy, unprofessional **Hestia Familia** notice. He recalled what little he knew about Miach (poor, kind, potion shop,
easy entry vs. slow growth). Then, despite all logic pointing against it for someone needing rapid growth, his intuition
strongly pulled him towards the Hestia notice. It felt like a destined, albeit strange, path. He decided to pursue
Hestia first, taking the flimsy flyer from the board.

However, the flyer offered no location. Realizing he needed directions, Isaiah scanned the Guild counters again,
deciding against approaching Eina immediately after their intense conversation. He spotted the **cat-eared Guild
employee** (Rose) he'd spoken to briefly yesterday (when asking about Hestia originally). Deciding she might be more
approachable, he headed to her slightly shorter queue.\
*(End of Recap: Day 3 - Beginning - Expanded Detail)*

**(Recap: Day 3 - Middle - Expanded Detail)**\
Isaiah joined the queue for the **cat-eared Guild employee (Rose)**\. While waiting, he observed her pleasant but
professional efficiency. When it was his turn, Rose recognized him immediately from his inquiry about Hestia
*yesterday*. Seeing Hestia wasn't with him *yet*, she greeted him with polite surprise and curiosity. Isaiah, adopting
a 'cool' demeanor, introduced himself properly ("Isaiah November"), bowed, and maintained intense eye contact while
asking for information on locating Goddess Hestia or her Familia. Rose, perhaps slightly intrigued or put off-balance by
his intensity but maintaining professionalism (subtle 'aura' effect), expressed surprise at the unusual request for such
an obscure Familia. Consulting Guild records, she confirmed Hestia Familia was known to be extremely small and poor,
with its registered 'Homestead' being a room within the **old, partially abandoned church on the eastern edge of the
Daedalus district**.

She asked, out of professional duty laced with curiosity, *why* he was seeking Hestia specifically.
Isaiah gave a smooth, slightly mysterious, metaphorical answer about "small sparks needing the right conditions to
become a wildfire," implying Hestia represented a unique opportunity away from the crowds, before thanking Rose for the
location and promptly leaving the counter. Rose watched him go, her curiosity likely piqued further by his unusual
answer and determination.

With a destination now, Isaiah left the Guild Hall (mid-morning) and began the walk towards the eastern Daedalus
district. As he walked, he reflected on **Ryu**, acknowledging how often she occupied his thoughts ('living rent-free')
and realizing with some irony that she didn't even know his name. This fueled his desire to become someone impressive.
He also briefly considered his original plan of using his first Familia merely as a stepping stone to Freya, comparing
it to his more recent intuition pulling him towards Hestia.

The journey took him through winding Daedalus streets, the atmosphere subtly shifting from affluent to slightly
neglected as he neared the eastern edge. He finally located the **abandoned church**, an old stone structure showing
signs of decay but with faint signs of life near a side annex (wisps of smoke, a tended patch). Steeling himself against
the strangeness of seeking a goddess here, he pushed through a rusty gate and approached the annex door. Just as he
raised his hand to knock, he heard a distinct **CRASH** from inside, followed by a muffled, high-pitched yelp.
Confused and slightly alarmed ("Umm, what?"), Isaiah hesitated, finding the idea of knocking on a god's door after
hearing such a sound deeply bizarre.

Pushing past the weirdness, he knocked firmly three times. After a pause and some
shuffling sounds, the door creaked open partially. Peering out was not a grand deity, but an incredibly **short, petite
young woman** (later confirmed Goddess **Hestia**) with dark hair in twin-tails, wearing a simple white dress smudged
with soot, and looking extremely flustered. Behind her, Isaiah glimpsed a cramped, cluttered basement room with
overturned potatoes scattered on the floor. Hestia, surprised by the tall, blue-haired adventurer at her door, initially
asked if he was lost or there for rent (prompting more confusion from Isaiah).

Isaiah, still bewildered but polite, introduced himself ("Isaiah November") and explained he was looking for Goddess
Hestia, asking if she was available, clearly assuming this diminutive individual was merely a resident or servant.
Hestia's eyes went wide. Realizing *he was asking for her*, she became intensely flustered, blushing furiously, snatched
the messy recruitment flyer Isaiah produced from his pocket (confirming he sought *her* Familia), and stammered an
affirmation: *"I am the Goddess Hestia!"* She tried to project dignity despite her appearance and the "potato
avalanche," her embarrassment quickly giving way to overwhelming excitement and hope. *"Are you... are you here
to *join*?!"* she burst out, grabbing Isaiah's wrist and insistently pulling him inside before he could change his mind.

Inside the cramped, cluttered room (now established via image references as having patchy plaster-over-stone walls, a
narrow wooden bed with purple sheets/headboard, a worn green-striped sofa, a low wooden table, a workbench, a washbasin,
a small hearth, and general clutter), Isaiah examined Hestia more closely. He noted her small stature, youthful face,
expressive blue eyes (currently wide with hope), simple attire, and surprisingly curvaceous figure beneath the dress – a
form full of contrasts. Hestia, meanwhile, bombarded him with questions: Was he strong? What could he do? Was he
*really* joining?

Isaiah felt his heart melt at her raw, desperate eagerness. He acknowledged internally that this feeling was different
from his fascination with Ryu – more protective, maybe responsible. He then recalled his original plan to use his first
Familia as a stepping stone to Freya and felt a sharp internal conflict. Looking at Hestia's vulnerable hope, the idea
of using and abandoning her felt deeply wrong. He then reconsidered his goal of impressing Ryu, realizing that achieving
greatness (like Hedin's challenge) even with a small Familia like Hestia's, combined with showing loyalty, might
actually be *more* impressive to someone like Ryu than just joining Freya. He entertained the highly satisfying,
audacious thought of completing Hedin's challenge only to *reject* Freya's offer, choosing loyalty to Hestia instead –
an idea he mentally "pocketed for later."

Bringing himself back to the present, Isaiah answered Hestia's questions. He confirmed he wanted to join, acknowledging
her notice led him there. He stated honestly he wasn't 'strong' yet by Orario standards but was quick, determined,
skilled with daggers, and believed he had potential. Hestia exploded with joy, tears streaming down her face, launching
herself forward to hug his waist (as high as she could reach). She ecstatically welcomed him as her "first real child,"
her "precious adventurer," declaring the Hestia Familia officially active.\
*(End of Recap: Day 3 - Middle - Expanded Detail)*

**(Recap: Day 3 - Ending - Expanded Detail)**\
Overjoyed and emotional, Hestia declared it was time for the **Falna ceremony**. After a moment of frantic searching
through the clutter ("Where did I put the needle?!"), she located the necessary items: an ornate silver needle and a
small pot of dark ink. Initially, in her excitement, she seemed ready to perform the blessing while Isaiah was standing,
simply telling him to take his shirt and armor off. Isaiah, finding the situation increasingly surreal (getting
undressed for a goddess he just met in a potato-filled cellar), questioned if lying down wouldn't be more practical.
Hestia, flustered but agreeing ("Oh! Right! Of course! Lying down!"), directed him towards the narrow wooden bed with
the purple blanket.

Isaiah walked over, briefly noting the simple, worn state of the bed and wondering if this was truly where the goddess
slept. He then lay face down as instructed, readying himself. Hestia, regaining a measure of divine focus, approached.
She pricked her own finger with the needle, drawing a bead of divine ichor, then touched the needle to Isaiah's back
between his shoulder blades. He felt a sharp prick followed by a strange, otherworldly warmth spreading beneath his
skin, like liquid sunlight, accompanied by a tingling sensation as the Status was inscribed. From Hestia's perspective,
glowing crimson divine hieroglyphs bloomed briefly on his skin before fading.

Once the process was complete, Hestia let out a shaky breath, slightly drained but again overwhelmed with tearful joy. "
It's done, Isaiah! You have my Falna! My blessing! Welcome to the Hestia Familia!" Isaiah slowly sat up on the bed,
still shirtless. The reality hit him – Falna. He had finally achieved the first, most critical step. A wave of powerful
emotion washed over him – relief from the journey, the hunger, the homelessness, the rejections – combined with the
validation of finally being accepted, and the unexpected warmth of Hestia's instant, fierce care. Uncharacteristically,
tears pricked his eyes and began to fall.

Overwhelmed, he impulsively leaned forward and wrapped Hestia (who was
standing beside the bed) in a tight, comforting hug, resting his head near her chest level.
Hestia, initially startled by the hug, immediately responded with her own surge of emotion. Feeling his relief and
vulnerability, she returned the embrace fiercely, patting his back comfortingly, reassuring him he was home now, safe,
part of her Familia. They shared a moment of powerful connection. After Isaiah expressed his sincere thanks and vowed
his loyalty ("I will stick by your side no matter what... I am your child now... nothing will come between us!"), Hestia
was deeply moved, reciprocating with her own vow to always protect and support him, declaring, "It's you and me against
the world now, Isaiah November!"

Regaining some composure, Hestia shifted back to planning, excitedly mentioning the need for Guild registration,
supplies, food (potato stew!), and regular Status updates. Isaiah then realized he needed to see his *initial* Status.
Hestia, remembering the correct procedure this time (after an AI correction), explained she needed to imprint it onto
paper using her ichor. She rummaged and found a suitable blank sheet of parchment. Isaiah, resignedly amused ("Again?"),
removed his shirt once more and stood presenting his back. Hestia pricked her finger again, touched his back, and
pressed the parchment against the Falna point.

The Status transferred magically onto the sheet in glowing crimson text.
Hestia excitedly presented the sheet to Isaiah. Holding it so they could both see, Isaiah examined his **first Status**:
Lv. 1, all basic abilities at I 0, no Magic listed. However, under Skills, there were two entries: **[Determined Heart]
** (Accelerates growth relative to strength of feelings/convictions) and, surprisingly, **[??????????]**. Isaiah was
immediately intrigued by Determined Heart's potential for meeting Hedin's challenge, and puzzled by the mysterious
second skill. Hestia was equally baffled but excited by the anomaly, taking it as further proof Isaiah was 'special'.

Just as Hestia was buzzing about plans for the Guild and Dungeon *immediately*, Isaiah was hit by a wave of profound
exhaustion (due to a user-requested time perception retcon making it evening). He let out a huge yawn, realizing it was
far too late for Guild business. More pressingly, he remembered he technically had no lodging for the night (his deal at
the inn was only for Day 2). He gently explained his exhaustion and asked Hestia where a member of her Familia was
supposed to stay.

Hestia deflated, embarrassed by the lack of resources. After attempting to justify the situation with "strategic
renovations," she admitted the church annex was all they had. She immediately, selflessly offered Isaiah the only bed (
the narrow one with purple sheets), suggesting she could sleep on potato sacks or rig a hammock. Isaiah, feeling it was
deeply wrong for a goddess to sleep on the floor because of him, gently but firmly refused her offer, stating it wasn't
proper and they needed another solution. Hestia, touched by his respect but flustered by the lack of options, started to
hesitantly suggest maybe they could *share* the narrow bed, given her small size, but cut herself off in embarrassment.
Isaiah, intrigued and amused, gently pressed her to finish the thought.

Mortified, Hestia admitted she'd briefly
considered sharing, purely for "practical reasons" and "thermal efficiency," while insisting it was a bad, awkward idea.
Isaiah, finding her flustered reaction adorable and seeing the pragmatic necessity, surprised her by calmly *agreeing*
to share the 'narrow sleeping resource', reassuring her with a gentle smile and promising to respect the 'rules' (
staying on his side, no blanket hogging).

Hestia, stunned into acceptance but still blushing furiously, agreed, laying
down strict (if flustered) rules. Isaiah then prepared for sleep, removing only outer gear but keeping his
shirt/trousers on out of respect. He settled onto his side of the narrow bed first. Hestia, after freshening up,
awkwardly and gingerly climbed onto her side, facing away, tense as a coiled spring. Isaiah, feeling the awkwardness but
also warmth, softly wished her goodnight ("Goodnight Hestia, my Goddess"), teasingly adding it "might make the bed
warmer" if she needed to shift closer.

Hestia squeaked indignantly but then hesitantly agreed moving slightly closer was
purely for "pragmatic reasons," while insisting the rules still stood. Isaiah, smiling secretly, murmured a final warm,
sleepy goodnight. Just as he drifted off, feeling Hestia's warmth nearby, he felt her shift slightly closer and heard a
whispered breath near his ear: *"Mine..."*\
*(End of Recap: Day 3 - Ending - Expanded Detail)*

**(Recap: Day 4 - Beginning - Expanded Detail - CORRECTED)**\
The first hints of grey dawn light were just beginning to seep through the grime on the single basement window when
Isaiah surfaced from a deep, relatively restful sleep. The exhaustion from the previous days' trials – the journey, the
confrontations, the emotional rollercoaster of finding Hestia and receiving Falna – had finally been subdued by hours of
uninterrupted rest. He felt... better. Soreness lingered in muscles unaccustomed to true relaxation, the thin mattress
beneath the purple blanket hadn't offered much luxury, but the bone-deep weariness was gone, replaced by a thrumming
readiness.

His first conscious sensation was warmth beside him, and the soft, even sound of breathing that wasn't his own. He
turned his head slowly on the pillow. **Hestia** lay beside him on the narrow wooden bed. Sometime during the night, her
rigidly maintained distance must have yielded to sleep's embrace; she was curled on her side, still mostly facing away
but having shifted slightly closer, occupying perhaps a bit more than her initially claimed sliver of mattress. Her dark
hair was a messy cascade against the blanket, twin-tails slightly askew, and her small form looked peaceful, utterly
vulnerable in slumber.

Isaiah lay still for a moment, simply observing. The awkwardness of the previous night's negotiation felt distant now,
overshadowed by the quiet intimacy of sharing this small space, this first morning as God and Child. He recalled her
tearful joy, her fierce declaration of support, her flustered rules for sharing the bed. A faint smile touched his lips.
This tiny goddess was a whirlwind of contradictions, but her belief in him felt absolute, almost terrifyingly so. The
memory of her whispering "Mine..." just before he fell asleep echoed faintly, sending a strange, unidentifiable warmth
through him that had nothing to do with the shared blanket.

The protective feeling from last night returned, stronger now in the quiet morning light. Seeing her unguarded state
reinforced his resolve. Hedin's challenge, the need for Valis, the desire to impress Ryu – those goals remained, but now
they were intertwined with a new, powerful imperative: *succeed for Hestia*. Justify her faith. Build *this* Familia,
however small, however poor, into something worthy of her unexpected, overwhelming kindness.
But success started with action. And action started with the Guild.

Carefully, meticulously, he began to ease himself out of the shared bed. He moved with deliberate slowness, lifting the
rough blanket inch by inch, sliding his legs over the edge, holding his breath at every slight creak of the wooden
frame. He glanced back – Hestia mumbled softly, nuzzling her face deeper into the mattress, but didn't wake. Relief
washed over him.

Standing silently on the cold stone floor in his undershirt and trousers, he stretched carefully, feeling the satisfying
pull in recovered muscles. The room was dim, cluttered, smelling faintly of dust and potatoes, yet it felt undeniably
like... home base. Their starting point.

He gathered his gear: the mustard jacket, the chest plate (checking the straps), the boots and gloves. He left the black
cloak folded where he'd left it yesterday – no need for it indoors or potentially in the Dungeon's upper levels just
yet. He checked his coin pouch – the meager 25-75 Valis felt insultingly light compared to the tasks ahead. Then, he
considered Hestia again.

She needed to be woken. They had to get to the Guild, ideally right as it opened, to get him registered. Every hour
counted today. He approached the side of the bed where she slept, the memory of her earlier panic making him hesitant.
Waking her gently was paramount. He knelt beside the bed, bringing himself closer to her level, appreciating again how
small and peaceful she looked. This time, remembering her flustered reaction from yesterday morning (in the previous
timeline loop, which Isaiah experienced), he decided against physical touch initially.

He pitched his voice low, soft, barely more than a murmur, trying to ease her awake rather than startle her. "
Goddess..." he whispered gently. "Hestia... time to wake up now..." He waited a beat, watching her face. She stirred
slightly, a frown creasing her brow. "Mmm... five more minutes..." she mumbled into the blanket, clearly deep asleep. He
smiled faintly. "Come on, Goddess," he murmured again, slightly louder but still gentle. "Big day today. Guild's opening
soon. Time to make the Hestia Familia official."\
*(End of Recap: Day 4 - Beginning - Expanded Detail*

**(Recap: Day 4 - Middle - Expanded Detail - Part 1)**\
Hestia eventually stirred awake at Isaiah's gentle prompting. Waking up to find him kneeling beside the bed might have
caused a brief flicker of renewed awkwardness or a blush, but having slept through the night beside him seemed to have
lessened the intensity compared to the theoretical panic of the previous day's initial 'waking up close' scenario (which
Isaiah experienced via time-loop/latent skill). Sleepy confusion quickly gave way to remembered purpose. Hearing "
Guild's opening soon" and "make the Hestia Familia official," Hestia scrambled awake, suddenly filled with boundless
energy and excitement.

There was a brief, slightly chaotic period of getting ready in the cramped space. Hestia likely insisted Isaiah turn
away while she quickly "freshened up" at the wash basin and perhaps changed into a slightly cleaner version of her
simple white dress (if she even owned one) and strapped on her sandals. Isaiah finished donning his own gear, feeling
the familiar weight of the chest plate, securing his daggers, and slinging his light backpack. He purposefully left the
black cloak behind. Hestia, buzzing with anticipation, grabbed her minuscule coin pouch.

Together, they left the relative sanctuary of the church annex and stepped out into the bright Orario morning. Hestia,
despite her divine status, practically skipped alongside Isaiah as they walked towards the Guild Hall, chattering
excitedly about their plans: registration, quests, earning Valis (enough for maybe something other than potatoes!), the
future glory of the Hestia Familia. Isaiah walked with a determined stride, listening to Hestia's optimistic plans,
feeling a mix of responsibility, amusement, and focused resolve. The odd pairing – the tall, blue-haired, determined
adventurer and the tiny, bouncing goddess – drew some curious glances from passersby, which Isaiah, focused on Hestia
and the goal ahead, likely remained oblivious to (Protagonist Magnetism/Obliviousness Rule).

They arrived back at the **Guild Hall** just as it was fully opening (around 7:00-7:30 AM). The main hall was already
bustling with the morning rush of adventurers. Hestia, perhaps slightly intimidated by the scale but puffing up with
pride, declared it was time for their "grand entrance." Isaiah, needing to get registered, scanned the counters. He
first spotted **Eina Tulle**, the elf advisor who had helped him yesterday and given him the Level 2 record information,
but also expressed significant concern about his ambition. Wary of potentially more warnings or skepticism, especially
now that he was partnered with the notoriously minor Hestia Familia, Isaiah then spotted the **cat-eared Guild
employee (Rose)**\ he'd asked for Hestia's location from yesterday. Deciding she might be a slightly smoother option for
the simple registration, Isaiah took the lead, gently counteracting Hestia's pull and guiding her towards Rose's shorter
queue, explaining, "Let's try this counter." Hestia, surprised but agreeable, followed his lead.

They reached Rose's counter after a short wait. Rose looked up and immediately recognized Isaiah from his specific
inquiry about Hestia the previous day. Seeing him now *with* the goddess, her eyes widened slightly in surprise, quickly
masked by professional politeness. "Ah, Mr. November," she greeted him, nodding respectfully to Hestia. "Goddess Hestia.
Welcome... It seems your inquiry from yesterday was quite successful, then." Isaiah confirmed smoothly that persistence
paid off and stated their purpose: "We're here to register this quest," he initially said, holding out the Goblin
Subjugation slip he'd selected earlier. *(Correction: He wouldn't register the quest *before* registering himself as an
adventurer under Hestia. The primary purpose was his own registration first).*

Isaiah corrected his approach: "We are here now to complete the official Guild registration process for me, Isaiah
November, as a member of the Hestia Familia," he stated confidently, gesturing to Hestia who beamed proudly. Eina Tulle,
who happened to be nearby or perhaps noticed the unusual pairing approaching a different counter, might have observed
this interaction with professional interest or subtle surprise from a distance. *(Self-correction: Focus remains on Rose
for now unless Eina actively intervenes based on rules).*

Rose processed this. "The Hestia Familia," she repeated, perhaps accessing the file mentally or physically, confirming
their near-zero status. She formally asked Hestia to confirm the bestowal of Falna, which Hestia did with gusto ("
Absolutely! Blessed him myself last night! My first child!"). Rose nodded, accepting the confirmation, and began the
official registration process, likely having Isaiah fill out forms (or confirming details verbally) and taking a
biometric imprint.

She commented neutrally on his choice being "unexpected" given earlier conversations (implicitly
referencing his questions to Eina, if Rose was aware, or just the general knowledge of Hestia's status) and remarked
that the path would require "considerable self-reliance." Finally, she issued his official **Adventurer Plate**: Isaiah
November, Lv. 1, Hestia Familia. She provided the standard warnings about the upper floors and the importance of Status
updates.

Isaiah, holding the tangible proof of his adventurer status, felt a surge of triumph. Ignoring Eina's potential
lingering scrutiny or Rose's subtle surprise, he turned beaming to Hestia, taking her hands and exclaiming, "It's
official, Goddess! We did it!" Hestia squeezed his hands back, equally ecstatic, proudly declaring him "*My*
adventurer!" Remembering they were in public, she quieted slightly but immediately pointed towards the **Quest Board
**. "Next stop... let's find you your first official job!"

They moved through the crowd to the board. Hestia excitedly pointed out the Level 1 section, particularly the **"Goblin
Subjugation - Floor 2" (800 Valis)**\ quest. Isaiah,__ considering quests vs. crystal income, asked Hestia why quests
were
necessary. She enthusiastically explained the benefits: guaranteed payout, specific objectives, reputation building,
potential bonuses – complementing crystal farming. **ust then, a friendly but cautious **young female adventurer** with
freckles nearby overheard them and warned that Floor 2 goblins were reportedly "swarming thick" today, asking Hestia if
she was really taking a new Level 1 there. Hestia confidently declared Isaiah could handle it. Isaiah thanked the girl
for the heads-up, then decisively plucked the Goblin Subjugation notice from the board.

Secretly, recalling his need for
rapid progress and Valis, and driven by the "no pain, no gain" mentality, his hand darted out again, smoothly taking the
**"Kobold Claws Needed (x10) - Floor 3" (600 Valis)**\ notice as well, tucking it away unseen by Hestia.\
*(End of Recap: Day 4 - Middle - Expanded Detail - Part 1)*

**(Recap: Day 4 - Middle - Part 2: Pre-Dungeon Interaction - Expanded Detail)**\
With the Goblin Subjugation quest slip officially in hand (and the Kobold Claw slip secretly pocketed), Isaiah felt the
reality of the next step pressing in. Hestia, oblivious to the second quest, was buzzing with excitement about the first
one. "Alright!" she chirped, "Quest accepted! Now, to the Dungeon entrance! Time to earn some Valis!" She started
tugging Isaiah towards the massive archway leading towards Babel Tower.

As they walked the short distance from the Quest Board area towards the Dungeon staging plaza, Isaiah found himself
anticipating the moment of separation. He expected Hestia to stop, offer final words, and let him proceed alone, as was
standard practice for deities and their children entering the Dungeon. He watched her, waiting for the inevitable
goodbye.

However, Hestia showed no signs of stopping. She continued chattering excitedly, pointing out parties gearing up,
offering probably outdated advice about goblin weak spots, completely caught up in the shared momentum of *their* first
official Familia activity. They passed the Guild attendants managing entry, getting closer and closer to the descending
stairs.

A sense of bewildered confusion struck Isaiah. *Doesn't she know she can't come in?* He gently pulled back just before
the threshold. "Uh, Hestia? Hold on." Hestia turned impatiently, "What is it? Don't get cold feet!" Isaiah, lowering his
voice, pointed out the fundamental rule: Gods couldn't enter the Dungeon. Hestia blinked, initially confused, then
argued dismissively, "Well, *technically*... but this is different! Your first delve! My first child! Of course, I need
to support you! It's just the upper floors!" She clearly didn't grasp the severity of the rule or felt her maternal duty
superseded it, suggesting she'd just "observe" and offer "moral support."

Seeing her genuine, misguided desire to accompany him stemmed from worry, Isaiah changed tactics. He dropped to one knee
before her, bringing himself to her eye level amidst the bustle of the Dungeon entrance. Looking into her eyes, trying
to convey gentle firmness and understanding, he took her hand. "Hestia," he began softly, acknowledging her desire to
protect him but explaining that the rules existed for a reason (her safety, the Dungeon's balance, his own growth). He
stressed that *he needed* to do this part alone. He saw tears welling in her eyes as the reality sank in – she couldn't
physically go with him.

He reassured her passionately, promising to be extremely careful, reminding her he had her Falna now. He framed his solo
entry not as rejecting her, but as needing to prove himself worthy, asking her to trust him. He promised to return safe,
invoking their planned Jagamarukun celebration as something to look forward to. Hestia, visibly torn between fear and
trusting him, pressed him ("You promise you'll be careful? No reckless stunts?"). Seeking reassurance, she finally,
reluctantly conceded with a shaky sigh and watery smile. "...Okay, Isaiah. If... if you really think you need to do this
alone first... Then... then I trust you." She squeezed his hand tightly. "Just... just be safe. Please. Come back
quickly. Your goddess will be waiting right here for you." She stepped back, giving him space.

Moved by her tears and reluctant trust, Isaiah acted instinctively. He reached up with the back of his hand, gently
wiping a tear from her cheek, offering a warm, confident smile. "It's okay. Really. Goblins on Floor 2... consider them
dealt with." Then, still kneeling, he pulled her small form into a firm, comforting hug, resting his chin briefly on her
head, trying to convey reassurance and affection without words. Hestia, surprised by the tenderness, stiffened
momentarily before relaxing into the embrace, perhaps clinging for a few seconds, drawing comfort.

Pulling back, Hestia looked up, eyes still glistening but fetr replaced by a determined, watery smile. "O-Okay," she
whispered, patting his cheek encouragingly. "You be careful. Stick to Floor 2 for now... Come back soon. With lots of
magic stones!" She gave a final nod, stepping back fully. "Go on," she said softly. "Go make the Hestia Familia proud."\
*(End of Recap: Day 4 - Middle - Part 2: Pre-Dungeon Interaction - Expanded Detail)*

**(Recap: Day 4 - Middle - Part 3: First Dungeon Delve - Expanded Detail)**\
Responding to Hestia's emotional blessing ("Go make the Hestia Familia proud"), Isaiah declared "Yes, Goddess!", spun
around sharply, and ran towards the Dungeon entrance beneath Babel Tower. After quickly presenting his newly issued
Adventurer Plate (Isaiah November, Lv. 1, Hestia Familia) to a bored Guild attendant and receiving the standard Floor
1-2 recommendation, he stepped onto the wide staircase plunging into shadow.

The transition was immediate. Bright light and noise gave way to the dim, eerie, **greenish-blue phosphorescent
moss-light** of **Floor 1**. The air grew cool, damp, smelling of earth and stone. The vast cavern stretched out, other
adventurers moving like ghosts in the gloom. Drawing his daggers, the familiar weight a comfort, Isaiah felt not fear,
but a profound sense of *rightness*. This was the proving ground. This was where he belonged. His ambition, thoughts of
Ryu, Hestia's faith, and Hedin's challenge coalesced into a burning drive.

His first kill came quickly: a lone **Goblin** spawning from a nearby wall. He dispatched it with swift efficiency,
watching it dissolve into smoke and particles, leaving behind his first **magic stone crystal**. The act felt necessary,
validating. He then encountered a group of **three Goblins** further down a passage. Using speed and flanking, he
eliminated them rapidly, collecting more crystals and the crucial goblin ears for quest proof. The Falna on his back
seemed to respond with a faint, encouraging warmth.

Finding Floor 1 Goblins almost too easy, Isaiah descended quickly to **Floor 2**. The layout here felt more complex, the
shadows deeper. The Goblins were fractionally tougher, their movements slightly more coordinated. He hunted them
relentlessly, driven by a cold focus bordering on bloodlust, fueled by his **[Determined Heart]** skill which seemed to
thrive on his fierce conviction. He engaged patrols of two, three, sometimes four, his twin daggers a blur, his agility
keeping him largely untouched. He systematically cleared sections, his pouches filling with ears and dim green crystals.
The warmth from his Falna grew into a steady hum.

Remembering the secret **Kobold Claw quest** and needing greater challenge for faster Excelia gain, Isaiah located a
passage leading deeper, descending cautiously towards **Floor 3**. The air grew colder, the atmosphere more oppressive.
He soon encountered **three Kobolds** – lean, fast, dog-like creatures with spears and claws. The fight was a clear step
up. He took a shallow scratch on his forearm from a claw swipe but managed to defeat them through skillful dodging and
precise strikes, harvesting **three sets of Kobold claws** and three brighter magic stones before wisely deciding a
deeper push alone was too risky *yet*. He retreated back towards Floor 2.

Returning to Floor 2, Isaiah resumed his goblin sweep with renewed intensity. Hours blurred in the dim light. While
moving through a wider cavern area, scanning for targets, he suddenly encountered another figure – a **solo adventurer**
clad in worn, dark leather armor, their face completely obscured by a deep hood. They were examining an ore vein in the
wall. The figure reacted warily, hand going to the hilt of their short sword. Isaiah, wary himself but wanting to avoid
conflict, feigned nonchalance, pretending to examine the cavern walls while subtly observing them. The hooded figure
eventually relaxed slightly and returned to chipping at the ore.

Curiosity lingering, Isaiah decided to try and learn more as he moved to leave the cavern via a path that took him
closer. Even at close range, the hood concealed the adventurer's face and race, revealing only practical, worn gear and
capable hands. Impulsively, Isaiah stopped after passing them and called out, "Oi!" The figure turned, wary again, hand
on sword. Trying to de-escalate and perhaps glean information, Isaiah feigned needing rope, asking if they had any
spare – a flimsy excuse. The adventurer responded, her voice revealing she was **female**, low and steady but
skeptical. "Rope? Down here? ...Why ask me?" she questioned, offering no help. Isaiah, having confirmed her gender but
realizing the interaction was pointless, shrugged it off ("Bad planning on my part") and walked away decisively, heading
into a different tunnel. The hooded woman immediately went back to her mining.

The encounter was a brief, strange interlude, a reminder of the Dungeon's other inhabitants. Shaking it off, Isaiah
refocused entirely on the hunt. He continued his sweep through Floor 2, then descended again to Floor 1, clearing out
the weaker goblins there with almost contemptuous ease. The goal was no longer just quest completion, but maximizing
kills, maximizing Excelia. He pushed himself relentlessly, fighting through the mounting physical fatigue, driven by the
constant hum of power from his Falna and the burning desire to meet Hedin's challenge.\
*(End of Recap: Day 4 - Middle - Part 3: First Dungeon Delve - Expanded Detail)*

**(Recap: Day 4 - Ending - Part 1: Exit & Guild Exchange/Report - Expanded Detail)**\
After what felt like an eternity spent relentlessly hunting through Floors 1, 2, and briefly 3, pushing his physical
limits far beyond anything he'd experienced before, Isaiah finally allowed himself to head towards the surface. The
relentless drive for Excelia had resulted in pouches heavy with goblin ears (far exceeding the quest minimum), ten
crucial Kobold claws, and a significant number of magic stone crystals, mostly low-quality goblin ones but including
several better Kobold stones. He was utterly spent, muscles burning, covered in grime, nursing minor scratches, but the
Falna on his back f elt intensely charged, humming with the potential gained over nearly twelve hours of non-stop combat
and exploration.

He ascended the final staircase from Floor 1, emerging from the dim, moss-lit Dungeon back into the brightly lit, noisy
staging area beneath Babel Tower. The contrast was jarring. He immediately sought out one of the large Guild clocks,
squinting through his fatigue. It read just past **6:30 PM**. Evening had fallen. The realization hit him: sundown
*yesterday* (Day 3) was the deadline for paying the innkeeper the remaining 80 Valis. He had missed it while getting
Falna from Hestia. His last **health potion**, left as collateral, was now forfeit – a stinging loss, but nothing to be
done now. The immediate priority shifted to converting his loot into Valis, reporting his quests, finding Hestia for a
Status update, and getting back to the church annex. The Guild counters might be closing soon.

Pushing through the thinning evening crowd in the Guild Hall, Isaiah made his way towards the **Material Exchange**
counter. The lines were shorter now. He queued briefly behind a couple of other adventurers before stepping up to a
tired-looking human male employee with ink-stained fingers. When asked "Exchange or Report?", Isaiah, fuzzy-headed with
exhaustion, asked for clarification. The employee patiently explained that 'Report' was for quest completion (showing
slip, providing proof like ears/claws, getting reward authorized) and 'Exchange' was for trading materials like magic
stones for Valis. Standard procedure was Report first, then Exchange.

Isaiah nodded understanding. He first placed the stamped duplicate slip for the **Goblin Subjugation (Floor 2)**\ quest
on the counter. "Reporting completion for this one." Then, trying to appear casual despite his fatigue and the audacity
of the claim, he immediately placed the second stamped slip beside it – the **Kobold Claw Collection (Floor 3)**\ quest
he had secretly taken. "And... also reporting completion for this one."

The employee froze, his weary expression snapping to sharp scrutiny. "Hold on," he said, picking up both slips. "Goblin
Subjugation, Floor 2... *and* Kobold Claws, Floor 3? Both accepted *today*? Both reported *completed* today? By a Level
1 adventurer... Hestia Familia... on his *first registered day*?" His suspicion was palpable. "Adventurer November," he
asked pointedly, "are you quite sure? Completing *both*, solo, on your first delve... is highly unusual. Frankly, it
borders on unbelievable. Did you perhaps... acquire these claws through other means?"

Caught off guard by the direct suspicion, Isaiah realized how his double completion looked. He knew he had no concrete
proof beyond the claws themselves. Thinking quickly, he calmly countered the suspicion. He argued the financial
illogic – why would a near-broke adventurer *buy* expensive Kobold claws only to turn them in for likely less Valis? He
explained the only way it made sense was if he collected them himself. He then mentioned encountering another **solo
adventurer** (the hooded woman) on Floor 3 near where he fought the last Kobolds, suggesting she could potentially (if
vaguely) corroborate his presence there, though he admitted he didn't know her name or face. He finished by stating
firmly he *did* collect the claws and had them ready as proof.

The employee listened intently, considering Isaiah's logical points and the mention of a potential witness, however
vague. While still finding the claim extraordinary, he lacked concrete evidence to deny it outright. With a resigned
sigh, he decided to proceed based on the physical proof. "Alright," he said. "Let's see the proof, then. Ten Kobold
claws... And the ears for the goblin quest."\
*(End of Recap: Day 4 - Ending - Part 1)*

**(Recap: Day 4 - Ending - Part 2: Guild Transactions & Departure - Expanded Detail)**\
Isaiah, prompted by the skeptical but procedurally bound Guild exchange employee, presented the proof for his completed
quests. He first emptied a pouch containing a large number of dried goblin ears onto the counter – far more than the
likely required amount. Then, with deliberate care, he laid out the **ten sharp, dark Kobold claws** gathered from Floor

3.

The employee meticulously examined the proofs. He counted the ten Kobold claws precisely, checked their condition (
finding them acceptable), and made a check mark on the relevant quest slip duplicate. Seeing the sheer quantity of
goblin ears, he didn't count them individually but verified they were indeed goblin ears and sufficient for the
subjugation quest, making another notation. "Proof verified for both quests," he declared neutrally, stamping both
duplicate slips with authorization marks. "Authorization for reward payment is approved." He directed Isaiah to take the
stamped slips to the **Treasury counter** further down the line to collect the actual Valis rewards, while he disposed
of the collected monster parts.

Before Isaiah could leave for the Treasury, the employee prompted him for the material exchange. "Now, regarding the
exchange for the magic stones..." Isaiah then emptied his other pouch onto the counter, revealing a cascade of faintly
glowing crystals – mostly small, greenish goblin stones, but including the **seven** slightly larger, brighter Kobold
stones he had collected (3 from the first foray, 4 from the second fight). The employee, perhaps slightly impressed by
the quantity gathered in one (albeit very long) day by a Level 1, efficiently sorted and weighed the stones. After
consulting his charts and making calculations, he announced the total exchange value: **385 Valis**. He counted out the
coins and pushed them across the counter.

Exhausted and slightly fuzzy-headed, Isaiah momentarily forgot where to take the quest slips for the reward payout. He
sheepishly asked the employee to repeat the directions. The employee, with a quiet sigh betraying his end-of-shift
weariness and slight impatience, pointed more sharply down the line towards the counter marked with scales or coins. "*
*Treasury** counter. Take the stamped slips there."

Isaiah quickly thanked the employee, swept the newly acquired 385 Valis into his pouch (bringing his total funds up
significantly, though the exact starting amount Day 1 is fuzzy, the *gain* was substantial), carefully collected his two
stamped quest slips, and headed purposefully towards the Treasury counter.

The Treasury area felt slightly more formal, and thankfully, there was almost no queue this late in the evening. He
stepped up to a **stern-looking older woman** with sharp grey eyes. Isaiah stated his name, Familia, and purpose –
collecting rewards for the two completed quests – placing both stamped slips before her. The woman's eyebrow arched
almost imperceptibly as she read the details: two quests, Floor 2 and 3, Hestia Familia, Level 1, all completed and
authorized today. She meticulously verified the authorization stamps against her own ledgers. Finding everything
procedurally correct despite the unusual circumstances, she calculated the total reward: 800 Valis (Goblins) + 600
Valis (Kobold Claws) = **1400 Valis**.

She retrieved the funds from a secure coffer – notably larger denomination coins or perhaps even small ingots – counted
them precisely twice, and stacked them neatly on the counter for Isaiah to verify. Confirming the amount was correct,
Isaiah swept the significant sum into his already heavier coin pouch. His total Valis was now substantial, close to 1800
Valis (385 from stones + 1400 from quests), a fortune compared to his arrival state, though still modest by experienced
adventurer standards. The Treasury clerk declared the transaction complete and immediately turned back to her work.
Isaiah, pocketing his Valis and slips, finally felt the full weight of the day's accomplishment. He had Falna, was
officially registered, had completed two quests (one quite challenging), survived nearly twelve hours in the Dungeon on
his first delve, and earned a significant amount of money.

The forfeited potion was a sting, but this success overshadowed it. His immediate thought now, overriding even the
exhaustion, was Hestia. He needed to find her, get his Status update, and head back to the church annex – home. He
turned from the Treasury counter and walked towards the Guild Hall exit once more, the weight of his coin pouch a heavy,
satisfying validation of the grueling day.\
*(End of Recap: Day 4 - Ending - Part 2)*

**(Recap: Day 4 - Ending - Part 3: Return to Hestia & Exhaustion - Expanded Detail)**\
Leaving the Guild Hall as evening deepened into night (around 7:00 PM or later), Isaiah was driven by one primary
thought: get back to Hestia and rest. The nearly 1800 Valis heavy in his pouch was a significant achievement, but the
physical and mental toll of the ~12-hour Dungeon delve was immense. Every muscle screamed, exhaustion weighing him down
like lead.

He began the long walk back towards the abandoned church on the eastern edge of the Daedalus district. The city streets
were quieter now, illuminated by lanterns casting long shadows. His pace was slow, shuffling, a stark contrast to his
determined strides earlier in the day. His mind replayed fragments – the gleam of goblin eyes, the clash of daggers, the
cold focus of the hunt, Hedin's challenge, Ryu's composed face, Hestia's tearful encouragement.

As he finally reached the correct street and saw the silhouette of the old church, he fumbled slightly with the rusty
gate due to his fatigue. Before he could even reach the annex door, it burst open, revealing **Hestia**, her face etched
with frantic worry. Seeing him, relief washed over her features, and she launched herself at him, crying his name,
throwing her arms around his waist in a fierce, trembling hug. She sobbed with relief, clinging tightly, expressing how
worried she'd been during his long absence ("Twelve hours! I thought something happened!"). She scanned him for
injuries, noting his exhaustion.

Isaiah, touched by her intense concern despite his own weariness, managed a weak smile and gently patted her head,
reassuring her he was okay, just tired, and that the "quests" were done. His accidental use of the plural "quests"
momentarily piqued Hestia's curiosity, but seeing his state, she didn't press immediately. Isaiah, realizing his slip
and feeling too exhausted to explain the secret Kobold quest right then, quickly suggested they head inside so he could
sit down.

Hestia, her worry shifting to immediate concern for his well-being, readily agreed and ushered him inside the cramped
annex room. Isaiah immediately collapsed onto the worn, green-striped **sofa**, the relief of being off his feet
immense. Hestia hovered nearby, anxiously asking if he needed water or food, her earlier excitement replaced by
concerned fussing. She wistfully mentioned their planned Jagamarukun celebration would have to wait until he rested,
then gently but firmly told him to rest now, assuring him he was "home."

Lying exhausted on the sofa, overwhelmed by fatigue and the wave of Hestia's genuine care, Isaiah felt a surprising
vulnerability. Without conscious thought, driven by the need for comfort, he silently extended his arms outwards in an
unspoken plea. Hestia, startled at first, quickly understood. Her expression softened with overwhelming tenderness, and
she leaned over him carefully, wrapping her small arms around him in a quiet, comforting embrace, whispering
reassurances ("It's alright... You did so well... You're safe now... Just rest.").

In his hazy, sleep-deprived state, feeling the unexpected warmth and safety, Isaiah murmured, "...will you... lay down
with me...?" The request was quiet, almost subconscious. Hestia initially reacted with intense shock and fluster ("
Wh-Wha-Wha—?!"), scrambling back slightly, protesting the impropriety while blushing furiously. However, seeing Isaiah's
utter exhaustion and likely interpreting his request as a plea for comfort due to vulnerability rather than anything
else, her resolve faltered. Torn between propriety and her duty/desire to care for her child, she rationalized it as "
protective oversight" and "thermal efficiency." With extreme awkwardness, she gingerly lay down stiffly on the narrow
sofa beside him, facing away, maintaining as much distance as possible.

Just as Isaiah was drifting off, feeling the warmth beside him, he instinctively draped an arm over Hestia's waist in
his sleep-haze, pulling her slightly closer for comfort, completely unaware of the implications. Hestia froze,
internally panicking at the sudden, intimate contact, but also feeling a confusing mix of warmth, security, and
burgeoning affection. Trapped by awkwardness and not wanting to wake the utterly exhausted Isaiah, she remained rigidly
still, wide-eyed in the dark, wondering how she'd survive the night. Eventually, exhaustion likely claimed her too, or
she remained tensely aware until Isaiah finally fell deeply asleep beside her on the sofa.\
*(End of Recap: Day 4 - Ending - Part 3)*

**(Recap: Day 5 - Beginning - Expanded Detail)**\
Isaiah surfaced from sleep slowly on the morning of Day 5, the dim grey light of early dawn filtering through the dusty
window of the church annex. His first sensation was one of surprising comfort and warmth, followed by the realization
that he felt significantly more rested than he had anticipated after the grueling previous day. The deep aches were
lessened, replaced by a functional readiness.

Turning his head slightly on the sofa cushion, he found the source of the warmth. **Hestia** was curled up fast asleep
beside him, facing him this time. Sometime during the night, her initial tense posture had completely relaxed, and she
had unconsciously shifted closer, nestled against his side, her dark hair spilling across the worn striped fabric. The
image was one of innocent, trusting slumber.

His mind quickly replayed the end of last night: collapsing onto the sofa, Hestia's worry, his silent plea for comfort,
her flustered agreement to share the sofa, his own half-asleep action of pulling her closer. Seeing her now, sleeping so
peacefully and closely, evoked a complex mix of feelings. Surprise, yes, but no panic. A definite awkwardness lingered,
but overlaid with a strange sense of warmth, comfort, and burgeoning affection/protectiveness. He found himself simply
watching her for a moment, appreciating the quiet intimacy.

Driven by a drowsy, impulsive curiosity, he leaned in slightly and inhaled the scent of her nearby hair – clean soap,
dust, and that unique Hestia-warmth. Then, emboldened, his hand moved tentatively, fingertips brushing her soft hair
back from her temple, then drifting down to trace the incredibly soft skin of her cheek. He marveled briefly at her
peaceful beauty, the contrast between her divine nature and her current vulnerable state. Finally, acting on an impulse
he barely understood and immediately questioned (*What am I doing?*), his finger brushed feather-lightly against her
lips. His heart hammered at the unexpected intimacy, the feeling similar in intensity to his thoughts of Ryu, but
different – warmer, perhaps, more protective, less about mystery and more about immediate connection. He quickly
retracted his hand.

Deciding it was definitely time to get up before things became even more awkward, but not wanting to startle Hestia
awake given their proximity, he opted against trying to sneak away (which might jostle the sofa). Instead, he decided to
wake her gently. Leaning slightly closer again, keeping his voice very low and soft, he murmured her name and title
repeatedly, "Goddess... Hestia... It's time to wake up..." He added a tender smile, aware she might panic upon waking
face-to-face.

Hestia stirred slowly, mumbling sleepily before her eyes fluttered open. They focused on Isaiah's face, inches away.
Realization dawned, and she reacted instantly, letting out a strangled gasp, scrambling backward against the sofa
cushions, pulling the blanket up defensively. A furious blush covered her face as she stammered his name and questioned
the time, mortified at being caught asleep so close.

Isaiah, anticipating some level of panic, immediately shifted into a calm, authoritative (almost older-brotherly) tone.
He stayed put initially, meeting her panicked gaze steadily. "Hestia. Hestia. It's okay," he said firmly but gently, his
voice meant to soothe. He repeated, "It's okay. See? Nothing happened. We just fell asleep. It's morning." He projected
reassurance, implicitly accepting the situation as fine between them. Hestia, caught by his calm steadiness, slowly
began to de-escalate. Her frantic energy subsided, though the blush remained. She loosened her grip on the blanket, took
shaky breaths, and managed a hesitant, whispered, "O-okay..." accepting his reassurance, though still clearly
embarrassed and unsure how to proceed.\
*(End of Recap: Day 5 - Beginning)*

**(Recap: Day 6 - Beginning - Expanded Detail)**\
Dawn's pale light filtered through the single grimy window of the church annex, illuminating dust motes dancing in the
still air. Having fallen asleep side-by-side in the narrow wooden bed the night before – an arrangement born from
Isaiah's vulnerable request and Hestia's flustered but ultimate agreement justified by 'practicality' and his quiet
declaration that he didn't care what others thought – the atmosphere upon waking was charged with a new, deliberate
intimacy.

Hestia awoke first, surfacing slowly into awareness of the warm, solid presence of Isaiah sleeping soundly behind her.
Memories of the previous night – the astonishing H-Rank Status reveal, the emotional intensity, Isaiah asking her to
share the bed because *he slept better* with her there, his bold whisper brushing against her ear – likely caused a
flush to rise even before she was fully conscious. Turning carefully, she found him facing her, asleep, his expression
peaceful. A wave of quiet, fierce tenderness washed over her. Driven by this unguarded affection, she reached out
hesitantly, gently brushing a lock of blue hair from his temple, her fingers lingering for a precious, private moment.

It was this feather-light touch that drew Isaiah from sleep. His eyes fluttered open, focusing instantly on Hestia's
face, so close, her fingers still resting against his temple, her expression soft and unguarded. Their eyes met. Hestia
froze, caught, a startled gasp escaping her as a deep blush exploded across her face.

Instead of pulling away or showing awkwardness, Isaiah, feeling the lingering warmth and comfort of the shared night and
perhaps emboldened by the previous evening's intimacy, offered a slow, sleepy smile. Then, acting on an impulse driven
by the confusing but pleasant connection, he tilted his head slightly, gently leaning *into* her touch, a clear,
non-verbal acceptance of her gentle gesture.

This unexpected positive reaction completely stunned Hestia. Her hand froze against his skin, her eyes wide with
astonished disbelief. Isaiah broke the charged silence first, murmuring a soft "Morning." This jolted Hestia back to
reality. Snatching her hand back as if burned, she stammered a breathless "M-Morning!" followed by the transparently
false excuse, "I... I was just... checking if you were still breathing!" Realizing how ridiculous it sounded, she
clamped her mouth shut, looking utterly mortified.

Isaiah, seeing through the flimsy lie, gently called her out, keeping his voice soft and understanding. "Hestia," he
said, sitting up slightly, "You don't have to make up fake reasons. It's okay." His non-judgmental acknowledgment seemed
to overwhelm her remaining defenses. Unable to respond, Hestia abruptly turned away, facing the wall, squeaking, "J-Just
get dressed, Isaiah! We need to… to plan! Yes! Plan the Dungeon!" desperate to escape the intimacy by focusing on
practicality.

Isaiah, acknowledging her need to shift focus but understanding the underlying connection, agreed it was time to get
ready. He got out of bed, retrieved his gear, and began the familiar process of dressing – undershirt, chest plate,
jacket, daggers. Hestia, keeping her back mostly turned initially, regained some composure and watched him finish, her
mind likely racing. Once Isaiah was fully geared, Hestia prompted him about the day's plan. Isaiah confirmed his
intention: Guild first to pick up a quest, then head straight to the Dungeon. Hestia, surprised he assumed he'd go
alone, immediately insisted on accompanying him, declaring it "Familia business" and her duty to support him every step
of the way. Isaiah, unable to refuse her earnest determination, conceded with a smile. Fully dressed and with a plan
agreed upon, they prepared to leave the annex together to start Day 6.\
*(End of Recap: Day 6 - Beginning - Expanded Detail)*

**(Recap: Day 6 - Middle - Expanded Detail)**\
Leaving the quiet sanctuary of the church annex, Isaiah and Hestia stepped out into the brighter light and bustling
activity of Orario mid-morning. Hestia, brimming with energy and purpose now that they had a plan and she was
accompanying her adventurer, led the way confidently. The walk took them from the slightly neglected eastern edge of the
Daedalus district back towards the city's vibrant core, the towering form of Babel growing ever larger against the sky.
Hestia chattered excitedly during the journey, pointing out various sights and likely offering unsolicited (and possibly
outdated) advice about Dungeon strategy or Guild procedures, reveling in her role as guide and supportive Goddess.
Isaiah walked beside her, focused on the day's objective, quietly appreciating her infectious enthusiasm.

They arrived at the massive, imposing Guild Hall, pushing through the heavy doors into the familiar, echoing chaos of
the main hall. The air hummed with the energy of hundreds of adventurers – queuing at counters, studying the quest
board, forming parties, the sounds of clanking gear and overlapping conversations filling the vast space. Hestia,
undaunted by the scale, immediately steered them towards the towering Quest Board dominating one wall.

Standing before the sea of notices, they began the task of selecting a suitable quest. Hestia diligently scanned the
lower-level sections, looking for a good balance of reward and manageable risk, perhaps suggesting options involving
specific monster parts or reliable payouts. Isaiah, mindful of his dramatically increased H-Rank stats (though Hestia
didn't know the *exact* numbers yet from the Day 5 update, she knew they were high) and Hedin's challenge, likely
scanned for quests that offered good Excelia potential, pushing slightly beyond basic Floor 1 or 2 tasks. After some
discussion, comparing options like collecting Dungeon Lizard hides or another Goblin subjugation, they settled on a
quest that seemed to fit both criteria: **"Kobold Fur Collection (x20) - Floors 2-3,"** with a reward of **850 Valis**.
It required hunting Kobolds, which Isaiah had proven capable of handling (albeit with difficulty initially), encouraged
exploration on both Floors 2 and 3, and offered a solid payout.

With the quest slip carefully extracted from the board and secured by Hestia, their immediate objective was clear. They
navigated back through the throng of adventurers in the Guild Hall, passing the long service counters and heading
towards the massive archways beneath Babel Tower that marked the entrance to the Dungeon. The air grew cooler as they
approached, the familiar scent of damp stone and distant monsters replacing the city smells. They reached the staging
area, a vast space where adventurers made their final preparations before descending. Guild attendants monitored the
entrance, checking plates and offering standard warnings.

Stopping near the top of the wide staircase plunging into shadow, the moment for their temporary farewell arrived.
Hestia turned to face Isaiah, her earlier excitement replaced by familiar concern, intensified perhaps by the quest
explicitly mentioning Floor 3. She took his hands, reminding him to be careful, acknowledging the danger of Kobolds even
with his improved abilities. She expressed her faith in him but pleaded for his safe return, reminding him she'd be
waiting. Isaiah, touched by her worry and feeling the weight of her trust, reassured her firmly, promising caution and
reminding her of his Falna and the new potions. He emphasized his readiness and promised to return safely with the furs
and significant progress. Driven by the lingering warmth and connection from the morning, he offered a comforting
gesture, gently cupping her cheek and brushing his thumb against her skin, suggesting she occupy herself while he was
gone. Hestia leaned into the touch briefly before pulling back, offering a final, teary but determined smile and
encouragement to make the Familia proud, her possessive whisper of *"Mine"* echoing softly as he turned away. With a
final nod, Isaiah turned resolutely towards the descending stairs, leaving Hestia watching from the entrance as he
stepped into the familiar greenish-blue gloom of the Dungeon to begin his second official delve.\
*(End of Recap: Day 6 - Middle - Expanded Detail)*

**(Recap: Day 6 - Ending - Expanded Detail)**\
Descending into the Dungeon's upper levels, Isaiah immediately felt the dramatic difference his H-Rank stats made.
Bolstered by DEX 95 I, AGI 92 I, STR 78 I, and END 81 I (his Status *before* the Day 5 evening update which pushed him
into H-Rank), Floor 1 Goblins became trivial, dispatched with effortless speed and precision. He moved through the
initial floor quickly, focusing on reaching the Kobold hunting grounds.

On Floor 2, the slightly tougher Goblins and occasional Kobolds still required attention but were handled with much
greater confidence and efficiency than his first delve. His movements were fluid, dodges instinctive, dagger strikes
landing with satisfying force. He began collecting the required Kobold furs systematically. Venturing down to Floor 3,
the increased danger was still apparent – Kobolds here were faster, more numerous, and coordinated – but Isaiah found he
could now manage encounters with small groups (three or four) effectively, relying on his vastly improved speed (
AGI/DEX) and endurance (END) to outmaneuver and outlast them, taking only minor glancing blows. The grim task of hunting
and skinning continued relentlessly for hours, driven by the quest goal and the constant hum of Hestia's Falna fueling
the [Determined Heart] skill, accelerating his Excelia gain with every kill.

During his sweep through a cavern on Floor 3, Isaiah had a brief, non-interactive encounter with a party of four clearly
higher-level adventurers passing through. Their competence and dismissive assessment served as a stark reminder of the
power levels still far above him, reinforcing his ambition. Shaking off the encounter, he refocused entirely on the
hunt.

After approximately **seven hours** of continuous, focused effort across Floors 2 and 3, Isaiah finally secured the *
*twentieth Kobold fur**, completing the quest objective. Exhaustion was setting in, a deep ache in his muscles despite
his improved Endurance, but satisfaction was immense. He had also collected a substantial number of Kobold and Goblin
magic stones. Deciding his work for the day was done, he began the ascent back towards the surface.
Emerging from Babel's base into the late afternoon light (around 2:00-3:00 PM), Isaiah headed straight for the nearby
Guild Hall. He efficiently reported the completed Kobold Fur quest, presenting the furs and receiving authorization for
the **850 Valis** reward. At the Material Exchange, he turned in his accumulated magic stones, netting approximately *
*2200 Valis**. His total earnings for the Day 6 delve amounted to roughly **3050 Valis**, significantly bolstering the
Familia's funds.

With business concluded, Isaiah began the walk back towards the church annex in the eastern Daedalus district. Tired but
buoyed by his success, he anticipated returning to Hestia. As he reached the familiar rusty gate and approached the
annex door, ready to knock, the door was pulled open from within. Hestia stood there, her face immediately flooding with
relief upon seeing him safe. She rushed forward, wrapping him in a tight, relieved hug, murmuring thanks that he was
back unharmed.

Caught up in the relief of returning safely, the success of the delve, and the surge of affection seeing Hestia's
reaction, Isaiah acted impulsively. As they stood in the doorway, he swiftly scooped the startled goddess into his arms,
bridal style, carrying her across the threshold into the annex room with a triumphant grin and a soft, "I'm home."
Hestia reacted with a startled squeak and intense shock, burying her face against his chest as he carried her inside.
Gently setting her down on the sofa, Isaiah observed her overwhelming fluster. She protested breathlessly about the
surprise, demanding warning next time, her cheeks burning but her eyes holding a complex mix of emotions beyond simple
panic. Isaiah, realizing he'd perhaps been too bold, apologized sincerely for startling her, promising "fair warning"
next time. Hestia, after a moment, accepted the apology with relief, though the lingering charge of the moment remained.
Eager to move past the embarrassment, she quickly shifted focus, asking about the quest results.

Isaiah confirmed the quest was complete and showed her the newly acquired Valis (approx. 3050 Valis earned, bringing
total funds to around 3355 Valis). Hestia reacted with predictable astonishment and joy at the substantial amount earned
in just one day, her pride in Isaiah swelling. Talk immediately turned to the next Status update. Isaiah readily agreed,
and they prepared for the familiar ritual, deciding to use the sofa again.

Isaiah sat facing away, and Hestia performed the update. Upon seeing the results on the parchment, Hestia gasped,
stunned into silence. She revealed the sheet to Isaiah, showing **H-Rank** achieved across all his physical stats (STR
142 H, END 155 H, DEX 168 H, AGI 161 H) after only his second day of delving. The growth was monstrously fast, exceeding
even her wildest hopes. Overwhelmed by awe and affection, Hestia instinctively touched Isaiah's arm, whispering about
his special potential and how *they* could achieve greatness together, her gaze intense and personal. Isaiah, stunned by
the stats and the intensity of her reaction, could only murmur her name. Hestia held the intense moment, offering a
soft, knowing smile before pulling back slightly, flustered, suggesting he needed rest.

Isaiah agreed, initially moving towards the sofa out of habit. Hestia, however, firmly insisted he take the bed this
time, arguing his H-Rank status and grueling effort demanded proper rest, overriding her own comfort out of fierce
protectiveness and duty. Isaiah, perhaps emboldened by the stats or the day's emotional intimacy, surprised her by
asking her to share the bed *with him*, admitting vulnerably that he slept better with her there. This direct,
emotionally driven request stunned Hestia into silence, followed by intense fluster and conflicted protests about
propriety. Eventually, overwhelmed by his vulnerability and her own burgeoning feelings, she hesitantly agreed,
justifying it as her duty to ensure his rest.

Isaiah, relieved and touched by her agreement, acknowledged her 'practical' justification before they both prepared for
bed. He asked her to come closer, stating he needed to tell her something. When she nervously approached, he requested
permission to whisper in her ear. Receiving silent, stunned consent, he leaned close and whispered intimately, *"I don't
care what people think,"* directly addressing her earlier fears about judgment and prioritizing their connection. Hestia
reacted with a shocked gasp and shiver, speechless, the whisper seemingly cutting through her anxiety but leaving her
reeling from the intimacy and boldness. Isaiah offered a soft smile and began settling into his side of the bed. Hestia,
after a moment, hesitantly joined him, lying down stiffly beside him. They lay in charged silence before Isaiah murmured
goodnight. Hestia softly reciprocated, adding a quiet, heartfelt "...Sleep well," which sent an unexpected shiver down
Isaiah's spine. Despite the lingering tension and confusion, exhaustion eventually claimed them both in the shared
intimacy of the narrow bed, concluding Day 6.\
*(End of Recap: Day 6 - Ending - Expanded Detail)*

**(Recap: Day 7 - Beginning - Expanded Detail)**\
The first rays of the Orario sun slanted through the dusty annex window, painting stripes of light across the cluttered
floor and illuminating the small space where Isaiah and Hestia lay tangled together in the narrow wooden bed. They had
fallen asleep the previous night after a day brimming with triumphs and unexpected intimacy – the astonishing H-Rank
Status reveal, the successful shopping trip funded by substantial earnings, the thoughtful gift of blue ribbons, the
impulsive bridal carry, and finally, Isaiah's vulnerable request to share the bed because he "slept better" with her
there, sealed by his bold whisper disregarding others' opinions. The deliberate choice to share the bed, based not on
necessity but on acknowledged comfort and connection, had left the air thick with unspoken emotion as they drifted off.

Hestia was the first to stir, surfacing slowly from a deep, peaceful sleep unlike any she'd had in recent memory.
Awareness dawned gradually – the warmth pressed against her front, the steady rhythm of breathing near her ear, the
solid weight of Isaiah's arm still loosely draped over her waist from sometime during the night. They had shifted closer
in sleep, ending up intertwined. Instead of the usual jolt of panic, a wave of quiet contentment washed over her.

Memories of yesterday warmed her: his incredible growth, his thoughtfulness with the ribbons, his protective reassurance
whispered in her ear. Lying here, safe and warm beside *her* adventurer, felt undeniably right. Carefully, barely daring
to breathe, she shifted her head just enough to look at him. He was facing her, asleep, his blue hair mussed, his
expression unguarded and peaceful. A fierce, possessive tenderness swelled in her chest. He was hers. This incredible
potential, this surprising gentleness, it was all hers. Acting on that overwhelming affection, her hand came up
hesitantly, fingers feather-light as she brushed a stray lock of hair from his forehead, then let her touch linger
softly against his temple, simply absorbing the quiet intimacy of the moment while she believed him asleep.

It was that gentle, lingering touch that pulled Isaiah towards consciousness. He surfaced slowly, his primary sensation
the comforting warmth surrounding him and the soft pressure against his temple. His eyes fluttered open, adjusting to
the dim light, and focused immediately on Hestia's face, inches away. He saw her soft, unguarded expression, her fingers
resting gently against his skin, her eyes holding a depth of affection he hadn't seen before. Their gazes locked.

Hestia froze, caught, a startled gasp escaping her as a deep blush instantly suffused her face. But this time, the panic
didn't take hold. Isaiah, too, felt different. Instead of the immediate awkwardness or confusion, a simple, sleepy smile
spread across his face. He didn't pull away. Instead, acting purely on the feeling of warmth and acceptance between
them, he tilted his head slightly, leaning *into* her touch, a clear, non-verbal signal of welcome.

His positive reaction shattered Hestia's fragile composure in a new way. Astonishment warred with overwhelming fluster.
She snatched her hand back as if shocked, stammering a breathless "M-Morning!" and the utterly transparent excuse, "I...
I was just... checking if you were still breathing!" – a desperate attempt to regain control.

Isaiah, seeing straight through the lie but understanding the overwhelming emotion behind it, sat up slightly. "Hestia,"
he said gently, his own sleepy smile still lingering, "You don't have to make up fake reasons. It's okay." His quiet
acceptance, his lack of judgment, seemed to expose her vulnerability even more. Utterly mortified at being caught both
in the intimate touch *and* the flimsy excuse, Hestia abruptly spun away, turning her back to him with a muffled
squeak. "J-Just get dressed, Isaiah! We need to plan!" she insisted, her voice high-pitched, desperately seeking refuge
in the day's practicalities. The charged intimacy of waking up entangled, followed by his gentle acceptance of her
touch, had clearly overwhelmed her ability to interact normally, leaving the morning thick with unspoken feelings as
they prepared to face Day 7 and the inevitable Status update.\
*(End of Recap: Day 7 - Beginning - Expanded Detail*

**(Recap: Day 8 - Middle - Expanded Detail)**\
Following the intense emotional and physical culmination of their relationship on the morning of Day 8, Isaiah and
Hestia lay tangled together in the narrow bed within the church annex. They were physically spent, slick with sweat,
breathing heavily, but filled with a profound sense of connection and peace. Isaiah had released inside Hestia, and they
had both reached a shared climax.

The immediate aftermath was one of deep intimacy and quiet tenderness. Hestia, trembling and overwhelmed, remained
nestled against Isaiah's chest. Isaiah held her close, offering silent comfort while processing the magnitude of what
had just occurred. The narrative detailed the "unjoining," emphasizing the physical reality of the wetness and lingering
fluids as they separated, a tangible reminder of their union.

Isaiah, acting with instinctive care, fetched a rough towel from the wash basin area. He knelt beside the bed and gently
cleaned Hestia's lower body, wiping away the evidence of their lovemaking with reverence and tenderness. Hestia, still
vulnerable and perhaps slightly embarrassed, accepted his ministrations with quiet trust, her earlier intense reactions
giving way to soft acceptance. Isaiah then quickly cleaned himself.

After the cleanup, Isaiah rejoined Hestia in the bed. The atmosphere was one of deep, settled intimacy, lacking the
awkwardness of previous nights. Hestia immediately snuggled close, resting her head against him, her body relaxed
against his. Isaiah held her securely.

In this quiet space, Isaiah initiated a conversation about their experience, reflecting on how "incredible" and "right"
it felt for him and asking Hestia how it was for her, expressing a flicker of lingering insecurity ("Was it... okay?").
Hestia responded with profound sincerity, stating it was "so much more than 'okay'," "perfect," and felt "like finally
coming home," confirming the depth of her own overwhelming positive experience and the sense of everything clicking into
place.
The conversation then shifted to Hestia's earlier panic about potential divine consequences (which occurred *before* the
consummation, but was discussed *after*). Isaiah listened as Hestia expressed her fear about violating the "no
children/Arcanum use" rule and risking expulsion to Tenkai. He gently reassured her, pointing out that if expulsion was
instantaneous, the fact she was still here (hours after the act) suggested the immediate trigger (perhaps tied to
conception) hadn't happened yet. He then firmly grounded her in the present reality of their connection ("Us is real")
and insisted they face *any* future outcome together, refusing to let fear ruin their present happiness.

This discussion helped ease Hestia's immediate panic, though the underlying anxiety about the potential risk remained as
a lingering shadow. Isaiah internally reflected on his own `[??????????]` skill, wondering if it could be related to
this situation or offer a loophole, but kept the thought to himself.
With the immediate crisis averted and their emotional connection reaffirmed, they settled back into the bed. The
emotional and physical release, combined with the comfort of holding each other and the peaceful atmosphere of the small
annex, led them to drift off into a deep, restorative **nap or sleep** that lasted several hours, covering the *
*afternoon** of Day 8.\

*(End of Recap: Day 8 - Middle / End - Expanded Detail)*

**(Recap: Day 9 - Beginning - Expanded Detail)**\
Day 9 dawned over Orario. Isaiah and Hestia awoke peacefully together in the narrow bed within the church annex,
having slept deeply through the night following the emotional and physical culmination of their relationship the
previous morning (Day 8) and subsequent restful afternoon/evening. The **morning light** filled the small space. The
atmosphere was one of profound comfort and established intimacy, a tangible result of their shared confessions, the
consummation of their love, and the resolution of relationship doubts the previous day. They woke up intertwined, the
physical closeness feeling natural and right.

They began their morning routine, getting ready for the day's planned Dungeon delve. This involved washing up at the
basin and getting dressed. Their movements were easy and comfortable, filled with soft touches and shared smiles,
reflecting their solidified bond. There was a new level of ease regarding physical proximity compared to previous
mornings.

With their gear donned and their plan set (two Floor 3 quests), they left the quiet sanctuary of the annex, stepping out
into the bright morning bustle of Orario. The air was crisp, carrying the promise of a clear day. They walked
hand-in-hand towards the city center, their steps purposeful, filled with a shared energy and excitement for the day's
challenges. Hestia chatted happily beside Isaiah, discussing potential quest types and anticipating the day's earnings.

Isaiah listened, enjoying her enthusiasm and the simple act of walking through the city together as partners.
Their walk took them back towards the **Hostess of Fertility**. They decided to stop here for **breakfast**, a slight
detour from immediately heading to the Guild. Upon entering, the tavern was bustling with the morning crowd, filled with
the smells of coffee, bacon, and pancakes. They were greeted by **Anya Fromel**, the cheerful cat-girl waitress, who
recognized Isaiah. They were seated at a booth, and Isaiah, while ordering an omelette and coffee, subtly scanned the
room, hoping to catch a glimpse of **Ryu Lion**, who was also working, but he was seemingly unnoticed by her. Hestia,
meanwhile, was utterly thrilled by the prospect of a proper, paid-for breakfast, specifically focusing on pancakes with
intense, joyful anticipation, seemingly oblivious to Isaiah's secondary motive for the location. They ate a satisfying
breakfast together, the comfortable domesticity contrasting with the intensity of the previous day.

After breakfast, they walked the short distance back towards the **Guild Hall** near Babel Tower. The main hall was busy
with the morning rush. Their destination was the **Quest Board**. They found the listings for Floor 3. Based on
maximizing combat encounters and synergy, they selected two quests for **today's delve**: **Kobold Commander Elimination
** (targeting a respawned Commander) and **Kobold Subjugation: Kill 30** (to complement the Commander hunt by clearing
surrounding mobs).

With the quest slips in hand, they headed towards a registration counter. They specifically went to **Rose**, the
cat-eared Guild employee who had helped Isaiah before. Rose recognized them and processed the two Floor 3 quests
efficiently, but her professional demeanor held subtle signs of heightened interest and surprise at the ambitiousness of
their combined choice for a solo Level 1, echoing her reaction from previous encounters with Isaiah's unusual
activities.

With the quests officially registered, their next step was the **Dungeon entrance** at the base of Babel Tower. As they
approached the wide staircase leading downwards, the moment for their temporary farewell arrived. Hestia stopped Isaiah,
her usual worry resurfacing, intensified by the specific, dangerous quests he had chosen. She took his hands, urging him
to be extra cautious, reminding him of the dangers of Floor 3 (Commander, Deep Zones, potential traps) and pleading for
his safe return. Isaiah reassured her firmly, promising caution and relying on his enhanced stats and her blessing. He
reaffirmed his commitment to returning safely *to her*.

As Hestia gave him her final blessing, her heart filled with that familiar mix of worry and fierce pride, she reached up
and **placed a quick, soft kiss on his cheek**. This act, a public display of affection between Goddess and adventurer,
occurred right at the busy **Dungeon entrance**. It was witnessed by several people nearby, including a Guild attendant,
other adventurers, a mysterious hooded figure, and crucially, **Rose** the Guild employee (who was passing by) –
planting seeds of gossip and further reinforcing Isaiah and Hestia's growing reputation as an "unusual" pair, with word
of the kiss likely reaching **Loki** (for teasing) and **Freya** (as a note on Isaiah's file) indirectly later.
Isaiah was momentarily surprised by the public kiss and felt a pang of desire for a longer one, but quickly suppressed
the urge due to the public setting. With the farewell exchanged and the kiss delivered, Isaiah turned towards the
stairs.\
*(End of Recap: Day 9 - Beginning - Expanded Detail)*

**(Recap: Day 9 - Middle - Expanded Detail)**\
Following the public farewell and Hestia's kiss at the Babel entrance, Isaiah descended into the **Dungeon** alone for
his third delve on **Day 9**. His objective: complete the **Kobold Commander Elimination** and **Kobold Subjugation (30
kills)** quests on Floor 3. He moved quickly through Floors 1 and 2, dispatching weak monsters with ease, his high
G-Rank Dexterity making them seem almost trivial. However, his caution was high due to the memory of yesterday's
coordinated ambush on Floor 2 and the presence of unusual tracks on Floor 1, which he dismissed for the time being.

He reached **Floor 3**, where the air was colder, the shadows deeper, and the Kobolds tougher. He began his hunt,
prioritizing efficiency to maximize Excelia for his rapid leveling goal. His G-Rank stats made short work of standard
Kobold patrols and Dungeon Lizards encountered along the way, his combat movements a blur of speed and precision, though
he noted his tactics leaned heavily on speed and evasion due to his daggers' limitations against heavier foes. He
quickly accumulated magic stones and added to his Kobold kill count for the subjugation quest.

As he pushed deeper, following signs of increasing Kobold activity and adventurer boot prints, he encountered the *
*first major anomaly** of this delve: Kobolds setting crude traps (tripwires, pitfalls) and actively digging a new
tunnel. This confirmed the unusual level of organization among the Kobinds on this floor, likely tied to the Commander.
He carefully bypassed the traps and decided to ignore the mysterious tunnel and the sounds coming from below for now,
prioritizing his quest objectives.

Continuing deeper into what felt like the "Deep Zone," he fought through more numerous and tougher Kobold patrols,
racking up his kill count. He was close to the 30-kill subjugation quota when he finally located the **Kobold
Commander's cavern**. The cavern was large, and across it sat the **Kobold Commander** on a makeshift throne, guarded by
**four significantly larger, armored Elite Kobolds** wielding swords. Isaiah immediately recognized it was a difficult
fight, but also the target for one of his quests.
Remembering his successful (and fast) assassination of the previous Commander yesterday, and confident in his newly
acquired G-Rank stats, Isaiah decided on a daring strategy: a direct, high-speed strike at the Commander to eliminate
the leader instantly and demoralize the guards.

He launched himself across the cavern in a blur of speed, bypassing the initial reactions of the Elite Guards. He leaped
onto the dais and aimed for the Commander's neck. Despite the Commander being partially armored and larger than the
previous one, Isaiah's G-Rank Dexterity and Strength allowed him to land **two direct, lethal dagger strikes** in quick
succession, killing the Commander instantly before it could fully rise or defend itself.

The sudden, brutal death of their leader shattered the discipline of the Elite Guards. Three of them broke and fled in
terror. The remaining guard made a brave but futile last stand and was quickly dispatched by Isaiah, completing the
Commander Elimination quest and bringing him close to the 30-kill subjugation quota.

Just as Isaiah finished securing the loot from the fallen Commander (a large Magic Shard and oversized fangs - proof for
his quest), and was about to collect the stones from the Elite Guards, a sudden commotion erupted from the tunnel the
fleeing guards had taken. The three terrified Elite Kobolds burst back into the cavern, pursued by an enraged **Minotaur
** – a powerful monster that should not have been on Floor 3. The Minotaur quickly and brutally slaughtered the fleeing
guards before turning its attention to Isaiah, the only living thing left.

Faced with the daunting, unexpected threat of a Minotaur, Isaiah realized he was cornered with no easy escape. Despite
the immense danger, he decided there was no other choice but to fight it solo, relying on his superior speed and agility
against its brute strength and powerful stone axe.

The fight was incredibly dangerous and pushed Isaiah to his limits. He used his G-Rank Dexterity and Agility to weave
around the Minotaur's charges and axe swings, suffering a **heavy blow to his side** from the flat of the axe (resulting
in suspected **cracked ribs**), but managing to avoid fatal damage through sheer speed and resilience. He landed
crucial, precise strikes with his daggers, notably targeting the Minotaur's eye to blind it and create an opening.

Mid-fight, **Ais Wallenstein** appeared in the cavern, having tracked the Minotaur (which she may have unintentionally
driven upwards). However, she did **not immediately intervene**, instead taking a position on a higher ledge to observe
the impossible sight of a Level 1 adventurer fighting a Minotaur solo. She watched Isaiah's tactics, speed, and
determination with intense, analytical curiosity.

Leveraging the opening created by blinding the Minotaur, and fueled by sheer will and [Determined Heart] despite his
injury, Isaiah delivered the final, lethal strikes to the beast's neck, successfully **defeating the Minotaur solo**.
Exhausted and in pain, Isaiah swayed, collected the valuable **Minotaur Magic Stone** and perhaps a horn or hide
fragment, and then **blacked out** from pain and fatigue just as he was about to secure his loot.
Ais Wallenstein then descended from her vantage point. She assessed Isaiah's condition (unconscious, injured), provided
him with one of her **potions** (acknowledging responsibility for the Minotaur's presence on Floor 3), and helped him
get into a more comfortable position.

Upon regaining consciousness, Isaiah saw Ais standing over him. She confirmed she had witnessed the fight and noted
his "abnormal" speed and growth rate, asking probing questions ("What are you?"). She instructed him to report the
Minotaur and organized Kobold activity to the Guild, emphasizing its unusual nature. She then escorted him out of the
Dungeon.\
*(End of Recap: Day 9 - Middle - Expanded Detail)*

**(Recap: Day 9 - Ending - Expanded Detail)**\
Emerging from the Dungeon into the bustling base of Babel Tower, **Day 9** was far from over for Isaiah. Exhausted and
injured from his solo Minotaur fight (cracked ribs), he was immediately met by **Ais Wallenstein**, who confirmed she
witnessed his victory (and collapse), gave him a potion to manage the pain, and escorted him out of the Dungeon. She
asked probing questions about his abilities ("What are you?") and instructed him to report the Minotaur and the unusual
Kobold activity to the Guild, acknowledging her own responsibility for the beast being on Floor 3. Isaiah, though weary,
agreed and made his way towards the Guild Hall.

At the **Guild Hall**, looking noticeably injured with his stained cloak and careful gait, Isaiah was quickly
intercepted by Advisor **Eina Tulle**, who immediately saw his state and expressed deep, poorly concealed personal
worry. After he briefly explained he had faced a Minotaur on Floor 3 (causing Eina shock and concern) and was instructed
by Ais Wallenstein to report anomalies, Eina insisted on taking him to the **Infirmary** first, placing her concerns
about his well-being above immediate procedure.

In the infirmary, Isaiah was examined by **Lyra Verrill**, a Guild healer with a distinctively cynical, probing, and
inappropriately forward demeanor. Lyra confirmed his likely cracked ribs and bandaged him tightly for support.
Throughout the examination, she made suggestive comments and conducted boundary-crossing 'tests' (touching his inner
thigh), showing a dangerous curiosity about his unusual physique and fast healing. Isaiah, though uncomfortable,
navigated the interaction without completely shutting down, and even offered a subtle, ambiguous comeback ("Depends on
who's doing the restricting"), piquing Lyra's intrigue. Lyra made a final unsettling comment about appreciating '
dedicated test subjects' before releasing him to Eina.

Returning to Eina's advisory station, still heavily bandaged and somewhat disoriented, Isaiah proceeded with his Guild
business. Since he was injured, Eina handled retrieving his quest rewards from the **Treasury** for him. His **Day 9
quests** (Kobold Commander Elimination #2 and Kobold Subjugation - 30 Kills) were verified by the Treasury clerk. The
fixed quest rewards totaled **1500 Valis**.

Next, he moved to the **Material Exchange** counter. He turned in all his drops from the Day 9 delve, including numerous
standard magic stones and monster parts, the Commander's Magic Shard and Fangs, and crucially, the **Minotaur Magic
Stone and Horn/Hide fragment**. The exchange employee was visibly surprised by the Minotaur loot. The total exchange
value for his materials was a staggering **21,500 Valis**, significantly higher than previous delves due to the high
value of the Minotaur drops. Adding the quest rewards, his total earnings from the Day 9 delve were **23,000 Valis**.
Combined with previous funds (~21,305 Valis after Day 10 breakfast cost), the Hestia Familia's total funds were now a
massive **~44,305 Valis**.

After concluding all Guild business, pocketing his massive Valis haul, Isaiah (injured but exhilarated by his success
and wealth) left the Guild Hall. He had a brief, final encounter with **Ais Wallenstein** upon leaving the Guild,
bumping into her and exchanging a few words where she again noted his capabilities and probed his reasoning.
He then made his way back to the **church annex** in the **late afternoon/early evening of Day 9**, carrying his wealth
and the mysterious parchment scroll found yesterday (Day 8). He was greeted at the door by **Hestia**, who was beside
herself with worry due to his long absence. Seeing he was back safe, relief flooded her, but quickly turned to concern
upon noticing his injury, despite his attempt to downplay it as a mere 'tumble fighting guards'.

Isaiah then revealed the true extent of his success by showing her the massive Valis haul (~23k Valis from today's
delve, ~44k total). Hestia's reaction was one of overwhelming, ecstatic joy and disbelief. She was completely consumed
by the sheer amount of money, bouncing, laughing, crying, and covering Isaiah with tearful, joyful kisses, listing all
the things they could now afford. Isaiah felt a deep sense of fulfillment in being able to provide for her and 'us'.
In the midst of her excitement, Isaiah remembered the **Status Update** for today's delve. They performed the ritual on
the sofa. The results were staggering: all his physical stats (STR, END, AGI, DEX) had reached **G-Rank!** The *
*[??????????]** skill also changed from "Dormant" to **"Resonance Detected - Stirring,"** adding a new layer of mystery
and potential.

Following the update, they had a vulnerable conversation about the skill's possible resonance (linked to 'us'?), which
led to Isaiah's (clumsy) suggestion of repeating intimacy for 'research'. This triggered Hestia's panic about the
divine "no children/Arcanum" rule and potential expulsion (a fear stemming from their unprotected sex the previous
morning - Day 8). Isaiah reassured her, emphasizing that the risk wasn't necessarily instantaneous and that they would
face anything together ('Us'), while suggesting they use protection next time like other Gods and mortals do. He also
apologized for his insensitive 'research' comment, reaffirming the specialness of their bond. Hestia accepted his
reassurance, the panic subsided, and she agreed they could be careful.

The conversation then shifted to planning for Day 10. Due to Isaiah's injury, they decided **no Dungeon delve tomorrow
**. Instead, they would use their wealth for a major **shopping trip**, prioritizing getting **better gear** (aiming for
top-tier like Hephaestus) and a **new, sturdy bed**.

As evening set in, they settled into comfortable intimacy. Isaiah asked Hestia to help him undress due to his injury, a
request she accepted with tender care. Isaiah got into bed, clad only in undergarments. Hestia changed into her shift (
openly this time, reflecting increased comfort) and got into bed beside him. She immediately initiated **deep,
possessive cuddling**, declaring "Your goddess is here," which surprisingly gave Isaiah "dommy-mommy" vibes, causing him
to fluster internally. Despite his internal reaction, he accepted her embrace.

The scene concluded with them falling asleep together in the narrow bed, cuddling closely, physically and emotionally
exhausted but secure in their acknowledged love and shared future.\

**(Recap: Day 10 - Beginning - Expanded Detail)**\
The Sun dawned over Orario. Isaiah awoke peacefully in the narrow bed within the church annex, feeling well-rested
and comfortable. He was still curled tightly against **Hestia**, his arm around her, hand resting on her hip, reflecting
the deep intimacy established the previous day (Day 9, after his return from the delve/Guild). The atmosphere was one of
quiet contentment and established intimacy, a stark contrast to the panic attack that had briefly shattered their sleep
in the middle of the night (Day 8 end / Day 9 beginning) and the emotional rollercoaster of Day 9 itself.

Hestia stirred and woke up, her eyes clear and soft, filled with immediate affection. She murmured a "Morning, Isaiah,"
and Isaiah replied with "Morning, my love," giving her a gentle kiss on the forehead, confirming they both slept well.
The morning was calm and affectionate, settling into the new normal of their relationship.

They began their morning routine of getting ready. As they started preparing to wash up, Isaiah, seeking to continue the
intimacy in a domestic way, softly asked Hestia, **"Can I wash your back?"** Hestia was surprised and blushed, but after
a moment of shy hesitation, she quietly agreed, turning her back to him before the basin. Isaiah gently and sweetly
washed her back with a cloth, cherishing the intimacy of the act. He finished the task with a soft kiss between her
shoulder blades, confirming he was "All done." Hestia reacted with a soft gasp and shiver to the kiss, remaining flushed
and shy but expressing thanks for the gentle care.

Following this, Hestia resumed getting ready. Isaiah watched as she removed her simple white sleeping shift. Unlike
previous days, she **changed openly** in front of him, reflecting the established comfort level between them. He
watched, appreciating her vulnerability and beauty, his mind recalling the intimacy they now shared.
Hestia then helped Isaiah finish getting dressed. Due to his still-healing cracked ribs (from the Day 9 Minotaur fight),
Isaiah asked her to help him undress from his gear. Hestia accepted with tender care, carefully helping him remove his
jacket and shirt over the bandages, then giving him space as he removed his trousers and boots himself, leaving him in
undergarments.

With their morning routine completed and both fully dressed in their day clothes (Isaiah with his cloak, but armor
packed due to injury; Hestia in her white dress), they confirmed their plan for the day. Due to Isaiah's ribs needing
rest, they decided **no Dungeon delve today**. Instead, they would use their massive Valis haul (~44,305 total) for a *
*Shopping Day**, prioritizing getting **better gear** (aiming for top-tier like Hephaestus) and a **new, sturdy bed**.
With their plan set, they left the quiet sanctuary of the annex, stepping out into the bright morning of Day 10, ready
to begin their shopping expedition.\

**(Recap: Day 10 - Middle - Expanded Detail)**\
After leaving the annex in the **morning of Day 10**, Isaiah and Hestia began their shopping expedition. They walked
from the eastern Daedalus district towards the city center, Hestia chatting excitedly about their plans and anticipated
purchases, while Isaiah walked with a determined stride, enjoying her enthusiasm and the simple act of being together.
At some point during their walk, Isaiah casually **took Hestia's hand**, a simple gesture of established intimacy that
Hestia accepted happily, squeezing his hand back and walking closer beside him.

Their first destination was the **Hephaestus Familia Workshop**. Upon arriving, they found it busy with customers and
the sounds of forging. Isaiah led Hestia inside, remarking about wondering if Lady Hephaestus herself might be present (
an unlikely thought for a casual visit, but reflecting the awe the place inspires). They made their way to the display
case holding the high-end daggers, specifically the sleek, curved Adamantite prototypes priced at nearly 20,000 Valis
*each*.

As they admired the daggers, **Lady Hephaestus herself** appeared, a surprising and significant encounter. Recognizing
Hestia (her friend), Hephaestus greeted her with wry warmth, then turned her sharp eye to Isaiah, noting he was Hestia's
new adventurer and assessing him. Hephaestus questioned if Isaiah had the skill (and surprisingly, the funds) to
consider blades like these.

Isaiah responded with surprising confidence bordering on cockiness, suggesting the Orichalcum daggers were "standard"
and might "hold him back," hinting he sought something with "more potential" forged from "rarer materials." Hephaestus,
likely having heard rumors of his Day 9 successes, was intrigued and challenged him to prove his discernment by handling
the Adamantite prototypes she had Tsubaki bring out.

Isaiah handled the Adamantite daggers, noting their superb physical quality but intuitively sensing an "energetic
instability" or lack of "perfect resonance" related to their potential for enchantment – an accurate assessment of the
tempering flaw. He honestly stated that while they felt incredible physically, they might have limitations for
high-level enchantment. He reaffirmed that compared to these, Orichalcum felt like a stepping stone.

Impressed by his discernment and honesty, and perhaps as a favor to Hestia and a gamble on Isaiah's potential,
Hephaestus offered a different proposal: sell him the flawed **Adamantite Prototype Daggers** (which she named **"
Hearthfire Blades"**) for a drastically reduced price of **50,000 Valis** (far below market value for Adamantite), with
a payment plan: **10,000 Valis down payment today**, and the remaining **40,000 Valis paid in installments** as he
earned them, due within three months.

Isaiah, overwhelmed with joy and gratitude at this incredible opportunity, accepted immediately. He formally signed an
agreement and paid the **10,000 Valis down payment** from their total funds (bringing their total from ~44,305 V down to
**~34,305 Valis**). He promised Hephaestus she wouldn't regret it and he would pay back the debt quickly. Hephaestus
formally transferred provisional ownership of the Hearthfire Blades to him, and he sheathed his new daggers, leaving his
old ones behind.

After the high-stakes negotiation, they left the Hephaestus workshop. With the main gear goal (provisionally) achieved,
they turned their attention to the other items on their shopping list. Hestia suggested they look for a new bed,
complaining about the narrowness and creakiness of their current one, hinting at its inadequacy for their shared
intimacy, suggesting a "sturdy" bed was needed. Isaiah, flushing at her bluntness, teasingly agreed.
They decided to explore the **artisan districts** further west, hoping to find a furniture workshop that would sell and
deliver a bed. They spent the next hour or so walking through these districts, enjoying the atmosphere and looking for
prominent furniture stores.

They eventually found **"Gareth & Sons Fine Furnishings,"** a reputable-looking workshop specializing in furniture.
Stepping inside, they browsed the showroom, discussing options for a new bedframe and mattress. They selected a sturdy
oak bedframe and a comfortable mattress, agreeing on a price of **8,000 Valis**.

Upon agreeing to the purchase, they discussed delivery. They arranged for the bed and mattress to be delivered to the
church annex the **following afternoon (Day 11)**, agreeing to pay a **300 Valis delivery fee**. Isaiah paid the 8,000
Valis for the bed plus the 300 Valis delivery fee from their remaining funds (bringing their total from ~34,305 V down
to **~26,005 Valis**). They received a receipt and confirmation.\

**(Recap: Day 10 - Ending - Expanded Detail)**\
After successfully purchasing the new bed (to be delivered Day 11) and securing the Hearthfire Blades (on payment plan),
Isaiah and Hestia left the furniture shop, "Gareth & Sons Fine Furnishings," in the **late afternoon of Day 10**. They
still had significant funds remaining (~26,005 Valis after purchases) and time left in the day. Hestia was excited about
the new bed and the events of the day, briefly teasing Isaiah about finding the "creaky springs" fun (prompting him to
blush), before they decided to look for other shopping necessities like food and home supplies.

As they walked back towards the central area, an alternative for dinner arose. Instead of cooking at the annex, Isaiah
suggested they go to the **Hostess of Fertility for dinner**, perhaps partly motivated by a lingering desire to see Ryu
Lion, but framing it as a way to enjoy their 'practically rich' status and have a stress-free meal. Hestia, despite a
brief moment of hesitation (perhaps due to the location or subtle possessiveness), was quickly won over by the allure of
a delicious, non-potato dinner and their ability to afford it. She eagerly agreed to the celebratory dinner.

They walked from the artisan district back towards the more central thoroughfares. Hestia chatted happily about the
day's successes and dinner plans. Isaiah's injured side (from the Day 9 Minotaur fight) ached, but the feeling of his
new Hearthfire Blades at his hip and the weight of his Valis pouches were strong motivators.

Upon arriving at the **Hostess of Fertility** in the **late afternoon/early evening**, the tavern was packed with the
dinner rush. They were greeted by one of the waitresses, a kind woman with blonde hair. Isaiah recognized her as someone
who worked there but didn't know her name. She informed them that tables were full and offered them to wait at the bar.
Isaiah clarified that they wanted to wait *for a table* at the bar, accepting the wait list. The waitress introduced
herself as **Syr**.

They were seated on stools at the bar, and Syr arranged for another waitress to take their drink orders while they
waited for a table. Isaiah, feeling the ache in his ribs and wanting something to dull the pain, ordered a potent local
spirit called **"Wyvern's Kiss,"** asking for whatever was strongest. Hestia, in a celebratory mood, ordered a glass of
**house red wine** and a **cheese plate**. Their drinks and snacks were served.

While sitting at the bar, Isaiah subtly scanned the room, first confirming **Syr** was working tonight (she passed by,
giving him a subtle look of recognition which piqued his interest) and then looking for **Ryu Lion**, who he hadn't seen
since breakfast. He did not spot Ryu immediately.

Isaiah checked in with Hestia, quietly using the endearment **"Sweetheart"** for the first time in a non-private setting
to gauge her reaction. Hestia loved the endearment, reacting with a deep, happy blush and expressing how wonderful the
wine and cheese were.

They sit at the bar, enjoying their drinks and snacks, waiting for a table for dinner. Isaiah feels the warmth of the
Wyvern's Kiss dulling his pain while Hestia enjoys her celebratory wine and cheese, her face soft with happiness after
hearing the endearment. Isaiah continues to scan the crowded tavern, subtly observing the passing staff, hoping to catch
a glimpse of Ryu, while Syr works nearby, aware of his presence.\
